&lsquo;<i>A CHARM OF BIRDS</i>.&rsquo; <a name="citation1"></a><a
href="#footnote1" class="citation">[1]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Is</span> it merely a fancy that we
English, the educated people among us at least, are losing that
love for spring which among our old forefathers rose almost to
worship?&nbsp; That the perpetual miracle of the budding leaves
and the returning song-birds awakes no longer in us the
astonishment which it awoke yearly among the dwellers in the old
world, when the sun was a god who was sick to death each winter,
and returned in spring to life and health, and glory; when the
death of Adonis, at the autumnal equinox, was wept over by the
Syrian women, and the death of Baldur, in the colder north, by
all living things, even to the dripping trees, and the rocks
furrowed by the autumn rains; when Freya, the goddess of youth
and love, went forth over the earth each spring, while the
flowers broke forth under her tread over the brown moors, and the
birds welcomed her with song; when, according to Olaus Magnus,
the Goths and South Swedes had, on the return of spring, a mock
battle between summer and winter, and welcomed the returning
splendour of the sun with dancing and mutual feasting, rejoicing
that a better season for fishing and hunting was
approaching?&nbsp; To those simpler children of a simpler age, in
more direct contact with the daily and yearly facts of Nature,
and more dependent on them for their bodily food and life, winter
and spring were the two great facts of existence; the symbols,
the one of death, the other of life; and the battle between the
two&mdash;the battle of the sun with darkness, of winter with
spring, of death with life, of bereavement with love&mdash;lay at
the root of all their myths and all their creeds.&nbsp; Surely a
change has come over our fancies.&nbsp; The seasons are little to
us now.&nbsp; We are nearly as comfortable in winter as in
summer, or in spring.&nbsp; Nay, we have begun, of late, to
grumble at the two latter as much as at the former, and talk (and
not without excuse at times) of &lsquo;the treacherous month of
May,&rsquo; and of &lsquo;summer having set in with its usual
severity.&rsquo;&nbsp; We work for the most part in cities and
towns, and the seasons pass by us unheeded.&nbsp; May and June
are spent by most educated people anywhere rather than among
birds and flowers.&nbsp; They do not escape into the country till
the elm hedges are growing black, and the song-birds silent, and
the hay cut, and all the virgin bloom of the country has passed
into a sober and matronly ripeness&mdash;if not into the sere and
yellow leaf.&nbsp; Our very landscape painters, till Creswick
arose and recalled to their minds the fact that trees were
sometimes green, were wont to paint few but brown autumnal
scenes.&nbsp; As for the song of birds, of which in the middle
age no poet could say enough, our modern poets seem to be
forgetting that birds ever sing.</p>
<p>It was not so of old.&nbsp; The climate, perhaps, was more
severe than now; the transition from winter to spring more
sudden, like that of Scandinavia now.&nbsp; Clearage of forests
and drainage of land have equalized our seasons, or rather made
them more uncertain.&nbsp; More broken winters are followed by
more broken springs; and May-day is no longer a marked point to
be kept as a festival by all childlike hearts.&nbsp; The merry
month of May is merry only in stage songs.&nbsp; The May garlands
and dances are all but gone: the borrowed plate, and the
milkmaids who borrowed it, gone utterly.&nbsp; No more does Mrs.
Pepys go to &lsquo;lie at Woolwich, in order to a little ayre and
to gather May-dew&rsquo; for her complexion, by Mrs.
Turner&rsquo;s advice.&nbsp; The Maypole is gone likewise; and
never more shall the puritan soul of a Stubbs be aroused in
indignation at seeing &lsquo;against Maie, every parish, towne,
and village assemble themselves together, both men, women, and
children, olde and young, all indifferently, and goe into the
woodes and groves, hilles and mountaines, where they spend the
night in pastyme, and in the morning they returne, bringing with
them birch bowes and braunches of trees to deck their assembly
withal. . . . They have twentie or fourtie yoke of oxen, every
oxe having a sweete nosegay of flowers tyed on the tippe of his
hornes, and these draw home this Maypole (this stincking idol
rather) which is covered all over with flowers and hearbes, with
two or three hundred men, women, and children following it with
great devotion. . .&nbsp; And then they fall to banquet and
feast, daunce and leap about it, as the heathen people did at the
dedication of their idolles, whereof this is a perfect pattern,
or the thing itself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This, and much more, says poor Stubbs, in his &lsquo;Anatomie
of Abuses,&rsquo; and had, no doubt, good reason enough for his
virtuous indignation at May-day scandals.&nbsp; But people may be
made dull without being made good; and the direct and only effect
of putting down May games and such like was to cut off the
dwellers in towns from all healthy communion with Nature, and
leave them to mere sottishness and brutality.</p>
<p>Yet perhaps the May games died out, partly because the
feelings which had given rise to them died out before improved
personal comforts.&nbsp; Of old, men and women fared hardly, and
slept cold; and were thankful to Almighty God for every beam of
sunshine which roused them out of their long hybernation;
thankful for every flower and every bird which reminded them that
joy was stronger than sorrow, and life than death.&nbsp; With the
spring came not only labour, but enjoyment:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In the spring, the young man&rsquo;s fancy
lightly turned to thoughts of love,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as lads and lasses, who had been pining for each other by
their winter firesides, met again, like Daphnis and Chloe, by
shaugh and lea; and learnt to sing from the songs of birds, and
to be faithful from their faithfulness.</p>
<p>Then went out troops of fair damsels to seek spring garlands
in the forest, as Scheffel has lately sung once more in his
&lsquo;Frau Aventiure;&rsquo; and, while the dead leaves rattled
beneath their feet, hymned &lsquo;La Regine Avrillouse&rsquo; to
the music of some Minnesinger, whose song was as the song of
birds; to whom the birds were friends, fellow-lovers, teachers,
mirrors of all which he felt within himself of joyful and tender,
true and pure; friends to be fed hereafter (as Walther von der
Vogelweide had them fed) with crumbs upon his grave.</p>
<p>True melody, it must be remembered, is unknown, at least at
present, in the tropics, and peculiar to the races of those
temperate climes, into which the song-birds come in spring.&nbsp;
It is hard to say why.&nbsp; Exquisite songsters, and those,
strangely, of an European type, may be heard anywhere in tropical
American forests: but native races whose hearts their song can
touch, are either extinct or yet to come.&nbsp; Some of the old
German Minnelieder, on the other hand, seem actually copied from
the songs of birds.&nbsp; &lsquo;Tanderadei&rsquo; does not
merely ask the nightingale to tell no tales; it repeats, in its
cadences, the nightingale&rsquo;s song, as the old Minnesinger
heard it when he nestled beneath the lime-tree with his
love.&nbsp; They are often almost as inarticulate, these old
singers, as the birds from whom they copied their notes; the
thinnest chain of thought links together some bird-like refrain:
but they make up for their want of logic and reflection by the
depth of their passion, the perfectness of their harmony with
nature.&nbsp; The inspired Swabian, wandering in the pine-forest,
listens to the blackbird&rsquo;s voice till it becomes his own
voice; and he breaks out, with the very carol of the
blackbird</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Vogele im Tannenwald pfeifet so hell.<br />
Pfeifet de Wald aus und ein, wo wird mein Sch&auml;tze sein?<br
/>
Vogele im Tannenwald pfeitet so hell.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And he has nothing more to say.&nbsp; That is his whole soul
for the time being; and, like a bird, he sings it over and over
again, and never tires.</p>
<p>Another, a Nieder-Rheinischer, watches the moon rise over the
L&ouml;wenburg, and thinks upon his love within the castle hall,
till he breaks out in a strange, sad, tender melody&mdash;not
without stateliness and manly confidence in himself and in his
beloved&mdash;in the true strain of the nightingale:</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Verstohlen geht der Mond auf,<br />
Blau, blau, Bl&uuml;melein,<br />
Durch Silberw&ouml;lkchen f&uuml;hrt sein Lauf.<br />
Rosen im Thal, M&auml;del im Saal, O sch&ouml;nste Rosa!<br />
* * *<br />
Und siehst du mich,<br />
Und siehst du sie,<br />
Blau, blau, Bl&uuml;melein,<br />
Zwei treu&rsquo;re Herzen sah&rsquo;st du nie;<br />
Rosen im Thal u. s. w.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is little sense in the words, doubtless, according to
our modern notions of poetry; but they are like enough to the
long, plaintive notes of the nightingale to say all that the poet
has to say, again and again through all his stanzas.</p>
<p>Thus the birds were, to the medi&aelig;val singers, their
orchestra, or rather their chorus; from the birds they caught
their melodies; the sounds which the birds gave them they
rendered into words.</p>
<p>And the same bird keynote surely is to be traced in the early
English and Scotch songs and ballads, with their often
meaningless refrains, sung for the mere pleasure of singing:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Binnorie, O
Binnorie.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;With a hey lillelu and a how lo lan,<br />
And the birk and the broom blooms bonnie.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;She sat down below a thorn,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Fine flowers in the valley,<br />
And there has she her sweet babe born,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the green leaves they grow rarely.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or even those &lsquo;fal-la-las,&rsquo; and other nonsense
refrains, which, if they were not meant to imitate bird-notes,
for what were they meant?</p>
<p>In the old ballads, too, one may hear the bird keynote.&nbsp;
He who wrote (and a great rhymer he was)</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As I was walking all alane,<br />
I heard twa corbies making a mane,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>had surely the &lsquo;mane&rsquo; of the &lsquo;corbies&rsquo;
in his ears before it shaped itself into words in his mind: and
he had listened to many a &lsquo;woodwele&rsquo; who first
thrummed on harp, or fiddled on crowd, how&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In summer, when the shawes be shene,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And leaves be large and long,<br />
It is full merry in fair forest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To hear the fowl&eacute;s&rsquo; song.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The wood-wele sang, and wolde not cease,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sitting upon the spray;<br />
So loud, it wakened Robin Hood<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In the greenwood where he lay.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Shakespeare&mdash;are not his scraps of song saturated
with these same bird-notes?&nbsp; &lsquo;Where the bee
sucks,&rsquo; &lsquo;When daisies pied,&rsquo; &lsquo;Under the
greenwood tree,&rsquo; &lsquo;It was a lover and his lass,&rsquo;
&lsquo;When daffodils begin to peer,&rsquo; &lsquo;Ye spotted
snakes,&rsquo; have all a ring in them which was caught not in
the roar of London, or the babble of the Globe theatre, but in
the woods of Charlecote, and along the banks of Avon, from</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The ouzel-cock so black of hue,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With orange-tawny bill;<br />
The throstle with his note so true:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The wren with little quill;<br />
The finch, the sparrow, and the lark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The plain-song cuckoo gray&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and all the rest of the birds of the air.</p>
<p>Why is it, again, that so few of our modern songs are truly
songful, and fit to be set to music?&nbsp; Is it not that the
writers of them&mdash;persons often of much taste and poetic
imagination&mdash;have gone for their inspiration to the
intellect, rather than to the ear?&nbsp; That (as Shelley does by
the skylark, and Wordsworth by the cuckoo), instead of trying to
sing like the birds, they only think and talk about the birds,
and therefore, however beautiful and true the thoughts and words
may be, they are not song?&nbsp; Surely they have not, like the
medi&aelig;val songsters, studied the speech of the birds, the
prim&aelig;val teachers of melody; nor even melodies already
extant, round which, as round a framework of pure music, their
thoughts and images might crystallize themselves, certain thereby
of becoming musical likewise.&nbsp; The best modern song writers,
Burns and Moore, were inspired by their old national airs; and
followed them, Moore at least, with a reverent fidelity, which
has had its full reward.&nbsp; They wrote words to music and not,
as modern poets are wont, wrote the words first, and left others
to set music to the words.&nbsp; They were right; and we are
wrong.&nbsp; As long as song is to be the expression of pure
emotion, so long it must take its key from music,&mdash;which is
already pure emotion, untranslated into the grosser medium of
thought and speech&mdash;often (as in the case of
Mendelssohn&rsquo;s Songs without Words) not to be translated
into it at all.</p>
<p>And so it may be, that in some simpler age, poets may go back,
like the old Minnesingers, to the birds of the forest, and learn
of them to sing.</p>
<p>And little do most of them know how much there is to learn;
what variety of character, as well as variety of emotion, may be
distinguished by the practised ear, in a &lsquo;charm of
birds&rsquo; (to use the old southern phrase), from the wild cry
of the missel-thrush, ringing from afar in the first bright days
of March, a passage of one or two bars repeated three or four
times, and then another and another, clear and sweet, and yet
defiant&mdash;for the great &lsquo;stormcock&rsquo; loves to sing
when rain and wind is coming on, and faces the elements as boldly
as he faces hawk and crow&mdash;down to the delicate warble of
the wren, who slips out of his hole in the brown bank, where he
has huddled through the frost with wife and children, all folded
in each other&rsquo;s arms like human beings, for the sake of
warmth,&mdash;which, alas! does not always suffice; for many a
lump of wrens may be found, frozen and shrivelled, after a severe
winter.&nbsp; Yet even he, sitting at his house-door in the low
sunlight, says grace for all mercies (as a little child once
worded it) in a song so rapid, so shrill, so loud, and yet so
delicately modulated, that you wonder at the amount of soul
within that tiny body; and then stops suddenly, as a child who
has said its lesson, or got to the end of the sermon, gives a
self-satisfied flirt of his tail, and goes in again to sleep.</p>
<p>Character?&nbsp; I know not how much variety of character
there may be between birds of the same species but between
species and species the variety is endless, and is shown&mdash;as
I fondly believe&mdash;in the difference of their notes.&nbsp;
Each has its own speech, inarticulate, expressing not thought but
hereditary feeling; save a few birds who, like those little dumb
darlings, the spotted flycatchers, seem to have absolutely
nothing to say, and accordingly have the wit to hold their
tongues; and devote the whole of their small intellect to sitting
on the iron rails, flitting off them a yard or two to catch a
butterfly in air, and flitting back with it to their nest.</p>
<p>But listen to the charm of birds in any sequestered woodland,
on a bright forenoon in June.&nbsp; As you try to disentangle the
medley of sounds, the first, perhaps, which will strike your ear
will be the loud, harsh, monotonous, flippant song of the
chaffinch; and the metallic clinking of two or three sorts of
titmice.&nbsp; But above the tree-tops, rising, hovering,
sinking, the woodlark is fluting, tender and low.&nbsp; Above the
pastures outside the skylark sings&mdash;as he alone can sing;
and close by, from the hollies rings out the blackbird&rsquo;s
tenor&mdash;rollicking, audacious, humorous, all but
articulate.&nbsp; From the tree above him rises the treble of the
thrush, pure as the song of angels: more pure, perhaps, in tone,
though neither so varied nor so rich, as the song of the
nightingale.&nbsp; And there, in the next holly, is the
nightingale himself: now croaking like a frog; now talking aside
to his wife on the nest below; and now bursting out into that
song, or cycle of songs, in which if any man finds sorrow, he
himself surely finds none.&nbsp; All the morning he will sing;
and again at evening, till the small hours, and the chill before
the dawn: but if his voice sounds melancholy at night, heard all
alone, or only mocked by the ambitious black-cap, it sounds in
the bright morning that which it is, the fulness of joy and
love.&nbsp; Milton&rsquo;s</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Sweet bird, that shun&rsquo;st the noise of
folly,<br />
Most musical, most melancholy,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is untrue to fact.&nbsp; So far from shunning the noise of
folly, the nightingale sings as boldly as anywhere close to a
stage-coach road, or a public path, as anyone will testify who
recollects the &lsquo;Wrangler&rsquo;s Walk&rsquo; from Cambridge
to Trumpington forty years ago, when the covert, which has now
become hollow and shelterless, held, at every twenty yards, an
unabashed and jubilant nightingale.</p>
<p>Coleridge surely was not far wrong when he guessed
that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Some night-wandering man, whose heart was
pierced<br />
With the remembrance of a grievous wrong,<br />
Or slow distemper, or neglected love<br />
(And so, poor wretch, filled all things with himself,<br />
And made all gentle sounds tell back the tale<br />
Of his own sorrow)&mdash;he, and such as he,<br />
First named these sounds a melancholy strain,<br />
And many a poet echoes the conceit.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That the old Greek poets were right, and had some grounds for
the myth of Philomela, I do not dispute; though Sophocles,
speaking of the nightingales of Colonos, certainly does not
represent them as lamenting.&nbsp; The Elizabethan poets,
however, when they talked of Philomel, &lsquo;her breast against
a thorn,&rsquo; were unaware that they and the Greeks were
talking of two different birds; that our English Lusciola
Luscinia is not Lusciola Philomela, one of the various birds
called Bulbul in the East.&nbsp; The true Philomel hardly enters
Venetia, hardly crosses the Swiss Alps, ventures not into the
Rhineland and Denmark, but penetrates (strangely enough) further
into South Sweden than our own Luscinia: ranging meanwhile over
all Central Europe, Persia, and the East, even to Egypt.&nbsp;
Whether his song be really sad, let those who have heard him
say.&nbsp; But as for our own Luscinia, who winters not in Egypt
and Arabia, but in Morocco and Algeria, the only note of his
which can be mistaken for sorrow, is rather one of too great joy;
that cry, which is his highest feat of art; which he cannot utter
when he first comes to our shores, but practises carefully,
slowly, gradually, till he has it perfect by the beginning of
June; that cry, long, repeated, loudening and sharpening in the
intensity of rising passion, till it stops suddenly, exhausted at
the point where pleasure, from very keenness, turns to pain;
and&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;In the topmost height of joy<br />
His passion clasps a secret grief.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How different in character from his song is that of the
gallant little black-cap in the tree above him.&nbsp; A gentleman
he is of a most ancient house, perhaps the oldest of European
singing birds.&nbsp; How perfect must have been the special
organization which has spread seemingly without need of
alteration or improvement, from Norway to the Cape of Good Hope,
from Japan to the Azores.&nbsp; How many ages must have passed
since his forefathers first got their black caps.&nbsp; And how
intense and fruitful must have been the original vitality which,
after so many generations, can still fill that little body with
so strong a soul, and make him sing as Milton&rsquo;s new-created
birds sang to Milton&rsquo;s Eve in Milton&rsquo;s
Paradise.&nbsp; Sweet he is, and various, rich, and strong,
beyond all English warblers, save the nightingale: but his
speciality is his force, his rush, his overflow, not so much of
love as of happiness.&nbsp; The spirit carries him away.&nbsp; He
riots up and down the gamut till he cannot stop himself; his
notes tumble over each other; he chuckles, laughs, shrieks with
delight, throws back his head, droops his tail, sets up his back,
and sings with every fibre of his body: and yet he never forgets
his good manners.&nbsp; He is never coarse, never harsh, for a
single note.&nbsp; Always graceful, always sweet, he keeps
perfect delicacy in his most utter carelessness.</p>
<p>And why should we overlook, common though he be, yon
hedge-sparrow, who is singing so modestly, and yet so firmly and
so true?&nbsp; Or cock-robin himself, who is here, as everywhere,
honest, self-confident, and cheerful?&nbsp; Most people are not
aware, one sometimes fancies, how fine a singer is cock-robin now
in the spring-time, when his song is drowned by, or at least
confounded with, a dozen other songs.&nbsp; We know him and love
him best in winter, when he takes up (as he does sometimes in
cold wet summer days) that sudden wistful warble, struggling to
be happy, half in vain, which surely contradicts
Coleridge&rsquo;s verse:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;In Nature there
is nothing melancholy.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But he who will listen carefully to the robin&rsquo;s breeding
song on a bright day in May, will agree, I think, that he is no
mean musician; and that for force, variety and character of
melody, he is surpassed only by black-cap, thrush, and
nightingale.</p>
<p>And what is that song, sudden, loud, sweet, yet faltering, as
if half ashamed?&nbsp; Is it the willow wren or the garden
warbler?&nbsp; The two birds, though very remotely allied to each
other, are so alike in voice, that it is often difficult to
distinguish them, unless we attend carefully to the
expression.&nbsp; For the garden warbler, beginning in high and
loud notes, runs down in cadence, lower and softer, till joy
seems conquered by very weariness; while the willow wren, with a
sudden outbreak of cheerfulness, though not quite sure (it is
impossible to describe bird-songs without attributing to the
birds human passions and frailties) that he is not doing a silly
thing, struggles on to the end of his story with a hesitating
hilarity, in feeble imitation of the black-cap&rsquo;s
bacchanalian dactyls.</p>
<p>And now, again&mdash;is it true that</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;In Nature there
is nothing melancholy&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mark that slender, graceful, yellow warbler, running along the
high oak boughs like a perturbed spirit, seeking restlessly,
anxiously, something which he seems never to find; and uttering
every now and then a long anxious cry, four or five times
repeated, which would be a squeal, were it not so sweet.&nbsp;
Suddenly he flits away, and flutters round the pendant tips of
the beech-sprays like a great yellow butterfly, picking the
insects from the leaves; then flits back to a bare bough, and
sings, with heaving breast and quivering wings, a short, shrill,
feeble, tremulous song; and then returns to his old sadness,
wandering and complaining all day long.</p>
<p>Is there no melancholy in that cry?&nbsp; It sounds sad: why
should it not be meant to be sad?&nbsp; We recognize joyful
notes, angry notes, fearful notes.&nbsp; They are very similar
(strangely enough) in all birds.&nbsp; They are very similar
(more strangely still) to the cries of human beings, especially
children, when influenced by the same passions.&nbsp; And when we
hear a note which to us expresses sadness, why should not the
bird be sad?&nbsp; Yon wood wren has had enough to make him sad,
if only he recollects it; and if he can recollect his road from
Morocco hither, he may be recollects likewise what happened on
the road&mdash;the long weary journey up the Portuguese coast,
and through the gap between the Pyrenees and the Jaysquivel, and
up the Landes of Bordeaux, and across Brittany, flitting by
night, and hiding and feeding as he could by day; and how his
mates flew against the lighthouses, and were killed by hundreds;
and how he essayed the British Channel, and was blown back,
shrivelled up by bitter blasts; and how he felt, nevertheless,
that &lsquo;that wan water he must cross,&rsquo; he knew not why:
but something told him that his mother had done it before him,
and he was flesh of her flesh, life of her life, and had
inherited her &lsquo;instinct&rsquo;&mdash;as we call hereditary
memory, in order to avoid the trouble of finding out what it is,
and how it comes.&nbsp; A duty was laid on him to go back to the
place where he was bred; and he must do it: and now it is done;
and he is weary, and sad, and lonely; and, for aught we know,
thinking already that when the leaves begin to turn yellow, he
must go back again, over the Channel, over the Landes, over the
Pyrenees, to Morocco once more.&nbsp; Why should he not be
sad?&nbsp; He is a very delicate bird, as both his shape and his
note testify.&nbsp; He can hardly keep up his race here in
England; and is accordingly very uncommon, while his two cousins,
the willow wren and the chiffchaff, who, like him, build for some
mysterious reason domed nests upon the ground, are stout, and
busy, and numerous, and thriving everywhere.&nbsp; And what he
has gone through may be too much for the poor wood wren&rsquo;s
nerves; and he gives way; while willow wren, black-cap,
nightingale, who have gone by the same road and suffered the same
dangers, have stoutness of heart enough to throw off the past,
and give themselves up to present pleasure.&nbsp; Why
not?&mdash;who knows?&nbsp; There is labour, danger, bereavement,
death in nature; and why should not some, at least, of the
so-called dumb things know it, and grieve at it as well as
we?</p>
<p>Why not?&mdash;Unless we yield to the assumption (for it is
nothing more) that these birds act by some unknown thing called
instinct, as it might be called <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>; and are, in
fact, just like the singing birds which spring out of
snuff-boxes, only so much better made, that they can eat, grow,
and propagate their species.&nbsp; The imputation of acting by
instinct cuts both ways.&nbsp; We, too, are creatures of
instinct.&nbsp; We breathe and eat by instinct: but we talk and
build houses by reason.&nbsp; And so may the birds.&nbsp; It is
more philosophical, surely, to attribute actions in them to the
same causes to which we attribute them (from experience) in
ourselves.&nbsp; &lsquo;But if so,&rsquo; some will say,
&lsquo;birds must have souls.&rsquo;&nbsp; We must define what
our own souls are, before we can define what kind of soul or
no-soul a bird may or may not have.&nbsp; The truth is, that we
want to set up some &lsquo;dignity of human nature;&rsquo; some
innate superiority to the animals, on which we may pride
ourselves as our own possession, and not return thanks with fear
and trembling for it, as the special gift of Almighty God.&nbsp;
So we have given the poor animals over to the mechanical
philosophy, and allowed them to be considered as only mere
cunningly devised pieces of watch-work, if philosophy would only
spare us, and our fine human souls, of which we are so proud,
though they are doing all the wrong and folly they can from one
week&rsquo;s end to the other.&nbsp; And now our self-conceit has
brought its own Nemesis; the mechanical philosophy is turning on
us, and saying, &lsquo;The bird&rsquo;s &ldquo;nature&rdquo; and
your &ldquo;human nature&rdquo; differ only in degree, but not in
kind.&nbsp; If they are machines, so are you.&nbsp; They have no
souls, you confess.&nbsp; You have none either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there are those who neither yield to the mechanical
philosophy nor desire to stifle it.&nbsp; While it is honest and
industrious, as it is now, it can do nought but good, because it
can do nought but discover facts.&nbsp; It will only help to
divide the light from the darkness, truth from dreams, health
from disease.&nbsp; Let it claim for itself all that it can prove
to be of the flesh, fleshly.&nbsp; That which is spiritual will
stand out more clearly as of the Spirit.&nbsp; Let it thrust
scalpel and microscope into the most sacred penetralia of brain
and nerve.&nbsp; It will only find everywhere beneath brain and
beneath nerve, that substance and form which is not matter nor
phenomenon, but the Divine cause thereof; and while it helps,
with ruthless but wholesome severity, to purge our minds from
idols of the cave and idols of the fane, it will leave untouched,
more clearly defined, and therefore more sacred and important
than ever&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Those

<p>as the poet-philosopher bids you.&nbsp; Victorious analysis
will neither abolish you, nor the miraculous and unfathomable in
you and in your song, which has stirred the hearts of poets since
first man was man.&nbsp; And if anyone shall hint to us that we
and the birds may have sprung originally from the same type; that
the difference between our intellect and theirs is one of degree,
and not of kind, we may believe or doubt: but in either case we
shall not be greatly moved.&nbsp; &lsquo;So much the better for
the birds,&rsquo; we will say, &lsquo;and none the worse for
us.&nbsp; You raise the birds towards us: but you do not lower us
towards them.&nbsp; What we are, we are by the grace of
God.&nbsp; Our own powers and the burden of them we know full
well.&nbsp; It does not lessen their dignity or their beauty in
our eyes to hear that the birds of the air partake, even a
little, of the same gifts of God as we.&nbsp; Of old said St.
Guthlac in Crowland, as the swallows sat upon his knee, &ldquo;He
who leads his life according to the will of God, to him the wild
deer and the wild birds draw more near;&rdquo; and this new
theory of yours may prove St. Guthlac right.&nbsp; St. Francis,
too&mdash;he called the birds his brothers.&nbsp; Whether he was
correct, either theologically or zoologically, he was plainly
free from that fear of being mistaken for an ape, which haunts so
many in these modern times.&nbsp; Perfectly sure that he himself
was a spiritual being, he thought it at least possible that birds
might be spiritual beings likewise, incarnate like himself in
mortal flesh; and saw no degradation to the dignity of human
nature in claiming kindred lovingly with creatures so beautiful,
so wonderful, who (as he fancied in his old-fashioned way)
praised God in the forest, even as angels did in heaven.&nbsp; In
a word, the saint, though he was an ascetic, and certainly no man
of science, was yet a poet, and somewhat of a philosopher; and
would have possibly&mdash;so do extremes meet&mdash;have hailed
as orthodox, while we hail as truly scientific,
Wordsworth&rsquo;s great saying&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Therefore am I still<br
/>
A lover of the meadows and the woods<br />
And mountains; and of all that we behold<br />
From this green earth; of all the mighty world<br />
Of eye and ear&mdash;both what they half create,<br />
And what perceive; well pleased to recognize<br />
In Nature and the language of the sense,<br />
The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,<br />
The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul<br />
Of all my moral being.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fishing</span> is generally associated in
men&rsquo;s minds with wild mountain scenery; if not with the
alps and cataracts of Norway, still with the moors and lochs of
Scotland, or at least with the rocky rivers, the wooded crags,
the crumbling abbeys of Yorkshire, Derbyshire, Hereford, or the
Lowlands.&nbsp; And it cannot be denied that much of the charm
which angling exercises over cultivated minds, is due to the
beauty and novelty of the landscapes which surround him; to the
sense of freedom, the exhilarating upland air.&nbsp; Who would
prefer the certainty of taking trout out of some sluggish
preserve, to the chance of a brace out of Edno or Llyn
Dulyn?&nbsp; The pleasure lies not in the prize itself, but in
the pains which it has cost; in the upward climbs through the
dark plantations, beside the rock-walled stream; the tramp over
the upland pastures, one gay flower-bed of blue and purple
butter-wort; the steady breathless climb up the crags, which
looked but one mile from you when you started, so clear against
the sky stood out every knoll and slab; the first stars of the
white saxifrage, golden-eyed, blood-bedropt, as if a fairy had
pricked her finger in the cup, which shine upon some green
cushion of wet moss, in a dripping crack of the cliff; the first
grey tufts of the Alpine club-moss, the first shrub of crowberry,
or sea-green rose-root, with its strange fleshy stems and leaves,
which mark the two-thousand-feet-line, and the beginning of the
Alpine world; the scramble over the arid waves of the porphyry
sea aloft, as you beat round and round like a weary pointer dog
in search of the hidden lake; the last despairing crawl to the
summit of the Syenite pyramid on Moel Meirch; the hasty gaze
around, far away into the green vale of Ffestiniog, and over
wooded flats, and long silver river-reaches, and yellow sands,
and blue sea flecked with flying clouds, and isles and capes, and
wildernesses of mountain peaks, east, west, south, and north; one
glance at the purple gulf out of which Snowdon rises, thence only
seen in full majesty from base to peak: and then the joyful run,
springing over bank and boulder, to the sad tarn beneath your
feet: the loosening of the limbs, as you toss yourself, bathed in
perspiration, on the turf; the almost awed pause as you recollect
that you are alone on the mountain-tops, by the side of the
desolate pool, out of all hope of speech or help of man; and, if
you break your leg among those rocks, may lie there till the
ravens pick your bones; the anxious glance round the lake to see
if the fish are moving; the still more anxious glance through
your book to guess what they will choose to take; what
extravagant bundle of red, blue, and yellow feathers, like no
insect save perhaps some jewelled monster from Amboyna or
Brazil&mdash;may tempt those sulkiest and most capricious of
trout to cease for once their life-long business of picking
leeches from among those Syenite cubes which will twist your
ankles and break your shins for the next three hours.&nbsp; What
matter (to a minute philosopher, at least) if, after two hours of
such enjoyment as that, he goes down again into the world of man
with empty creel, or with a dozen pounders and two-pounders,
shorter, gamer, and redder-fleshed than ever came out of Thames
or Kennet?&nbsp; What matter?&nbsp; If he has not caught them, he
might have caught them; he has been catching them in imagination
all the way up; and if he be a minute philosopher, he holds that
there is no falser proverb than that devil&rsquo;s
beatitude&mdash;&lsquo;Blessed is he who expecteth nothing, for
he shall not be disappointed.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Say, rather, Blessed is he who expecteth everything, for he
enjoys everything once at least: and if it falls out true, twice
also.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Pleasant enough is mountain fishing.&nbsp; But
there is one objection against it, that it is hard work to get to
it; and that the angler, often enough half-tired before he
arrives at his stream or lake, has left for his day&rsquo;s work
only the lees of his nervous energy.</p>
<p>Another objection, more important perhaps to a minute
philosopher than to the multitude, is, that there is in
mountain-fishing an element of excitement: an element which is
wholesome enough at times for every one; most wholesome at all
times for the man pent up in London air and London work; but
which takes away from the angler&rsquo;s most delicate enjoyment,
that dreamy contemplative repose, broken by just enough amusement
to keep his body active, while his mind is quietly taking in
every sight and sound of nature.&nbsp; Let the Londoner have his
six weeks every year among crag and heather, and return with
lungs expanded and muscles braced to his nine months&rsquo;
prison.&nbsp; The countryman, who needs no such change of air and
scene, will prefer more homelike, though more homely,
pleasures.&nbsp; Dearer than wild cataracts or Alpine glens are
the still hidden streams which Bewick has immortalized in his
vignettes, and Creswick in his pictures; the long glassy shallow,
paved with yellow gravel, where he wades up between low walls of
fern-fringed rock, beneath nut, and oak, and alder, to the low
bar over which the stream comes swirling and dimpling, as the
water-ouzel flits piping before him, and the murmur of the
ringdove comes soft and sleepy through the wood.&nbsp; There, as
he wades, he sees a hundred sights and hears a hundred tones,
which are hidden from the traveller on the dusty highway
above.&nbsp; The traveller fancies that he has seen the
country.&nbsp; So he has; the outside of it, at least: but the
angler only sees the inside.&nbsp; The angler only is brought
close face to face with the flower, and bird, and insect life of
the rich river banks, the only part of the landscape where the
hand of man has never interfered, and the only part in general
which never feels the drought of summer, &lsquo;the trees planted
by the waterside whose leaf shall not wither.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pleasant are those hidden waterways: but yet are they the more
pleasant because the hand of man has not interfered with
them?</p>
<p>It is a question, and one which the older one grows the less
one is inclined to answer in the affirmative.&nbsp; The older one
grows, the more there grows on one the sense of waste and
incompleteness in all scenery where man has not fulfilled the
commission of Eden, &lsquo;to dress it and to keep it;&rsquo; and
with that, a sense of loneliness which makes one long for home,
and cultivation, and the speech of fellow men.</p>
<p>Surely the influence of mountain scenery is exaggerated
now-a-days.&nbsp; In spite of the reverend name of Wordsworth
(whose poetry, be it remembered, too often wants that element of
hardihood and manliness which is supposed to be the birthright of
mountaineers), one cannot help, as a lowlander, hoping that there
is a little truth in the threnodes of a certain peevish friend
who literally hates a mountain, and justifies his hatred in this
fashion:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I do hate mountains.&nbsp; I would not live among them
for ten thousand a year.&nbsp; If they look like paradise for
three months in the summer, they are a veritable inferno for the
other nine; and I should like to condemn my mountain-worshipping
friends to pass a whole year under the shadow of Snowdon, with
that great black head of his shutting out the sunlight, staring
down into their garden, overlooking all they do in the most
impertinent way, sneezing and spitting at them with rain, hail,
snow, and bitter freezing blasts, even in the hottest
sunshine.&nbsp; A mountain?&nbsp; He is a great stupid giant,
with a perpetual cold in his head, whose highest ambition is to
give you one also.&nbsp; As for his beauty, no natural object has
so little of its own; he owes it to the earthquakes that reared
him up, to the rains and storms which have furrowed him, to every
gleam and cloud which pass over him.&nbsp; In himself he is a
mere helpless stone-heap.&nbsp; Our old Scandinavian forefathers
were right when they held the mountain Yotuns to be helpless
pudding-headed giants, the sport of gods and men: and their
English descendant, in spite of all his second-hand sentiment,
holds the same opinion at his heart; for his first instinct,
jolly honest fellow that he is, on seeing a snow alp, is to
scramble up it and smoke his cigar upon the top.&nbsp; And this
great stupid braggart, pretending to be a personage and an
entity, which, like Pope&rsquo;s monument on Fish-street
hill,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Like a tall
bully, lifts the head and lies,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I am called upon now-a-days to worship, as my better, my
teacher.&nbsp; Shall I, the son of Odin and Thor, worship Hrymir
the frost giant, and his cows the waterfalls?&nbsp; Shall I bow
down to the stock of a stone?&nbsp; My better?&nbsp; I have done
an honest thing or two in my life, but I never saw a mountain do
one yet.&nbsp; As for his superiority to me, in what does it
consist?&nbsp; His strength?&nbsp; If he be stronger than I, let
him cut stones out of my ribs, as I can out of his.&nbsp; His
size?&nbsp; Am I to respect a mountain the more for being 10,000
feet high?&nbsp; As well ask me to respect Daniel Lambert for
weighing five-and-twenty stone.&nbsp; His cunning
construction?&nbsp; There is not a child which plays at his foot,
not an insect which basks on his crags, which is not more
fearfully and wonderfully made; while as for his grandeur of
form, any college youth who scrambles up him, peel him out of his
shooting jacket and trousers, is a hundred times more beautiful,
and more grand too, by all laws of art.&nbsp; But so it is.&nbsp;
In our prurient prudery, we have got to despise the human, and
therefore the truly divine, element in art, and look for
inspiration, not to living men and women, but to leaves and
straws, stocks and stones.&nbsp; It is an idolatry baser than
that of the old Canaanites; for they had the courage to go up to
the mountain tops, and thence worship the host of heaven: but we
are to stay at the bottom, and worship the mountains
themselves.&nbsp; Byron began the folly with his misanthropic
&ldquo;Childe Harold.&rdquo;&nbsp; Sermons in stones?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe in them.&nbsp; I have seen a better sermon in
an old peasant woman&rsquo;s face than in all the Alps and
Apennines of Europe.&nbsp; Did you ever see any one who was the
better for mountains?&nbsp; Have the Alps made * * * a whit
honester, or * * * a whit more good-natured, or Lady * * * a whit
cleverer?&nbsp; Do they alter one hair&rsquo;s breadth for the
better the characters of the ten thousand male and female noodles
who travel forth to stare at them every year?&nbsp; Do mountains
make them lofty-minded and generous-hearted?&nbsp; No.&nbsp;
C&aelig;lum, non animum mutant, qui trans mare currunt.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t talk to me of the moral and physical superiority of
mountain races, for I tell you it is a dream.&nbsp; Civilization,
art, poetry, belong to the lowlands.&nbsp; Are the English
mountaineers, pray, or the French, or the Germans?&nbsp; Were the
Egyptians mountaineers, or the Romans, or the Assyrians, as soon
as they became a people?&nbsp; The Greeks lived among mountains,
but they took care to inhabit the plains; and it was the sea and
not the hills which made them the people which they were.&nbsp;
Does Scotland owe her life to the highlander, or to the
lowlander?&nbsp; If you want an experimentum crucis, there is
one.&nbsp; As for poetry, will you mention to me one mountain
race which has written great poetry?&nbsp; You will quote the
Hebrews.&nbsp; I answer that the life of Palestine always kept to
the comparatively low lands to the west of Jordan, while the
barbarous mountaineers of the eastern range never did
anything,&mdash;had but one Elijah to show among them.&nbsp;
Shakspeare never saw a hill higher than Malvern Beacon; and yet I
suppose you will call him a poet?&nbsp; Mountaineers look well
enough at a distance; seen close at hand you find their chief
distinctions to be starvation and ignorance, fleas and goitre,
with an utter unconsciousness&mdash;unless travellers put it into
their heads&mdash;of the &ldquo;soul-elevating glories&rdquo; by
which they have been surrounded all their lives.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He was gently reminded of the existence of the Tyrolese.</p>
<p>&lsquo;You may just as wisely remind me of the
Circassians.&nbsp; What can prove my theory more completely than
the fact that in them you have the two finest races of the world,
utterly unable to do anything for humanity, utterly unable to
develop themselves, because, to their eternal misfortune, they
have got caged among those abominable stoneheaps, and have not
yet been able to escape?&rsquo;</p>
<p>It was suggested that if mountain races were generally
inferior ones, it was because they were the remnants of conquered
tribes driven up into the highlands by invaders.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And what does that prove but that the stronger and
cunninger races instinctively seize the lowlands, because they
half know (and Providence knows altogether) that there alone they
can become nations, and fulfil the prim&aelig;val
mission&mdash;to replenish the earth and subdue it?&nbsp; No, no,
my good sir.&nbsp; Mountains are very well when they are doing
their only duty&mdash;that of making rain and soil for the
lowlands: but as for this newfangled admiration of them, it is a
proof that our senses are dulled by luxury and books, and that we
require to excite our palled organ of marvellousness by signs and
wonders, &aelig;sthetic brandy and cayenne.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I
have remarked often that the most unimaginative people, who can
see no beauty in a cultivated English field or in the features of
a new-born babe, are the loudest ravers about glorious sunsets
and Alpine panoramas; just as the man with no music in his soul,
to whom a fugue of Sebastian Bach, or one of Mendelssohn&rsquo;s
Songs without Words, means nothing, and is nothing thinks a
monster concert of drums and trumpets uncommonly fine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>This is certainly a sufficiently one-sided diatribe.&nbsp;
Still it is one-sided: and we have heard so much of the other
side of late, that it may be worth while to give this side also a
fair and patient hearing.</p>
<p>At least he who writes wishes that it may have a fair
hearing.&nbsp; He has a sort of sympathy with Lord
Macaulay&rsquo;s traveller of a hundred and fifty years since,
who amid the &lsquo;horrible desolation&rsquo; of the Scotch
highlands, sighs for &lsquo;the true mountain scenery of
Richmond-hill.&rsquo;&nbsp; The most beautiful landscape he has
ever seen, or cares to see, is the vale of Thames from Taplow or
from Cliefden, looking down towards Windsor, and up toward
Reading; to him Bramshill, looking out far and wide over the rich
lowland from its eyrie of dark pines, or Littlecote nestling
between deer-spotted upland and rich water-meadow, is a finer
sight than any robber castle of the Rhine.&nbsp; He would not
complain, of course, were either of the views backed, like those
glorious ones of Turin or Venice, by the white saw-edge of the
distant Alps: but chiefly because the perpetual sight of that
Alp-wall would increase the sense of home, of guarded security,
which not the mountain, but the sea, or the very thought of the
sea, gives to all true Englishmen.</p>
<p>Let others therefore (to come back to angling) tell of moor
and loch.&nbsp; But let it be always remembered that the men who
have told of them best have not been mountaineers, but lowlanders
who carried up to the mountain the taste and knowledge which they
had gained below.&nbsp; Let them remember that the great
Sutherlandshire sportsman and sporting writer, the late Mr. St.
John, was once a fine gentleman about town; that Christopher
North was an Edinburgh Professor, a man of city learning and city
cultivation; and, as one more plea for our cockney chalk-streams
of the south, that Mr. Scrope (who passed many pleasant years
respected and beloved by Kennet side, with Purdy at his heels)
enjoyed, they say, the killing of a Littlecote trout as heartily
as he did that of a Tweed salmon.</p>
<p>Come, then, you who want pleasant fishing-days without the
waste of time and trouble and expense involved in two hundred
miles of railway journey, and perhaps fifty more of highland
road; and try what you can see and do among the fish not sixty
miles from town.&nbsp; Come to pleasant country inns, where you
can always get a good dinner; or, better still, to pleasant
country houses, where you can always get good society; to rivers
which will always fish, brimfull in the longest droughts of
summer, instead of being, as those mountain ones are, very like a
turnpike-road for three weeks, and then like bottled porter for
three days; to streams on which you have strong south-west
breezes for a week together on a clear fishing water, instead of
having, as on those mountain ones, foul rain spate as long as the
wind is south-west, and clearing water when the wind chops up to
the north, and the chill blast of &lsquo;Clarus Aquio&rsquo;
sends all the fish shivering to the bottom; streams, in a word,
where you may kill fish (and large ones) four days out of five
from April to October, instead of having, as you will most
probably in the mountain, just one day&rsquo;s sport in the whole
of your month&rsquo;s holiday.&nbsp; Deluded friend, who suffered
in Scotland last year a month of Tantalus his torments, furnished
by art and nature with rods, flies, whisky, scenery, keepers,
salmon innumerable, and all that man can want, except water to
fish in; and who returned, having hooked accidentally by the tail
one salmon&mdash;which broke all and ween to sea&mdash;why did
you not stay at home and take your two-pounders and
three-pounders out of the quiet chalk brook which never sank an
inch through all that drought, so deep in the caverns of the
hills are hidden its mysterious wells?&nbsp; Truly, wise men bide
at home, with George Riddler, while &lsquo;a fool&rsquo;s eyes
are in the ends of the earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Repent, then; and come with me, at least in fancy, at six
o&rsquo;clock upon some breezy morning in June, not by roaring
railway nor by smoking steamer, but in the cosy four-wheel, along
brown heather moors, down into green clay woodlands, over white
chalk downs, past Roman camps and scattered blocks of Sarsden
stone, till we descend into the long green vale where, among
groves of poplar and abele, winds silver Whit.&nbsp; Come and
breakfast at the neat white inn, of yore a posting-house of
fame.&nbsp; The stables are now turned into cottages; and instead
of a dozen spruce ostlers and helpers, the last of the postboys
totters sadly about the yard and looks up eagerly at the rare
sight of a horse to feed.&nbsp; But the house keeps up enough of
its ancient virtue to give us a breakfast worthy of
Pantagruel&rsquo;s self; and after it, while we are looking out
our flies, you can go and chat with the old postboy, and hear his
tales, told with a sort of chivalrous pride, of the noble lords
and fair ladies before whom he has ridden in the good old times
gone by&mdash;even, so he darkly hints, before &lsquo;His Royal
Highness the Prince&rsquo; himself.&nbsp; Poor old fellow, he
recollects not, and he need not recollect, that these great
posting-houses were centres of corruption, from whence the newest
vices of the metropolis were poured into the too-willing ears of
village lads and lasses; and that not even the New Poor Law
itself has done more for the morality of the South of England
than the substitution of the rail for coaches.</p>
<p>Now we will walk down through the meadows some half mile,</p>
<blockquote><p>While all the land in flowery squares,<br />
Beneath a broad and equal-blowing wind<br />
Smells of the coming summer,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to a scene which, as we may find its antitype anywhere for
miles round, we may boldly invent for ourselves.</p>
<p>A red brick mill (not new red brick, of course) shall hum for
ever below giant poplar-spires, which bend and shiver in the
steady breeze.&nbsp; On its lawn laburnums shall feather down
like dropping wells of gold, and from under them the stream shall
hurry leaping and laughing into the light, and spread at our feet
into a broad bright shallow, in which the kine are standing
knee-deep already: a hint, alas! that the day means heat.&nbsp;
And there, to the initiated eye, is another and a darker hint of
glaring skies, perspiring limbs, and empty creels.&nbsp; Small
fish are dimpling in the central eddies: but here, in six inches
of water, on the very edge of the ford road, great tails and
back-fins are showing above the surface, and swirling suddenly
among the tufts of grass, sure sign that the large fish are
picking up a minnow-breakfast at the same time that they warm
their backs, and do not mean to look at a fly for many an hour to
come.</p>
<p>Yet courage; for on the rail of yonder wooden bridge sits,
chatting with a sun-browned nymph, her bonnet pushed over her
face, her hayrake in her hand, a river-god in coat of velveteen,
elbow on knee and pipe in mouth, who, rising when he sees us,
lifts his wide-awake, and halloas back a roar of comfort to our
mystic adjuration,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Keeper!&nbsp; Is the fly up?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mortial strong last night, gentlemen.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Wherewith he shall lounge up to us, landing-net in hand, and
we will wander up stream and away.</p>
<p>We will wander&mdash;for though the sun be bright, here are
good fish to be picked out of sharps and stop-holes&mdash;into
the water-tables, ridged up centuries since into furrows forty
feet broad and five feet high, over which the crystal water
sparkles among the roots of the rich grass, and hurries down
innumerable drains to find its parent stream between tufts of
great blue geranium, and spires of purple loosestrife, and the
delicate white and pink comfrey-bells, and the
avens&mdash;fairest and most modest of all the waterside nymphs,
who hangs her head all day long in pretty shame, with a soft
blush upon her tawny check.&nbsp; But at the mouth of each of
those drains, if we can get our flies in, and keep ourselves
unseen, we will have one cast at least.&nbsp; For at each of
them, in some sharp-rippling spot, lies a great trout or two,
waiting for beetle, caterpillar, and whatsoever else may be
washed from among the long grass above.&nbsp; Thence, and from
brimming feeders, which slip along, weed-choked, under white
hawthorn hedges, and beneath the great roots of oak and elm,
shall we pick out full many a goodly trout.&nbsp; There, in yon
stop-hole underneath that tree, not ten feet broad or twenty
long, where just enough water trickles through the hatches to
make a ripple, are a brace of noble fish, no doubt; and one of
them you may be sure of, if you will go the proper way to work,
and fish scientifically with the brace of flies I have put on for
you&mdash;a governor and a black alder.&nbsp; In the first place,
you must throw up into the little pool, not down.&nbsp; If you
throw down, they will see you in an instant; and besides, you
will never get your fly close under the shade of the brickwork,
where alone you have a chance.&nbsp; What use in throwing into
the still shallow tail, shining like oil in the full glare of the
sun?</p>
<p>&lsquo;But I cannot get below the pool
without&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>Without crawling through that stiff stubbed hedge, well set
with trees, and leaping that ten-foot feeder afterwards.&nbsp;
Very well.&nbsp; It is this sort of thing which makes the
stay-at-home cultivated chalk-fishing as much harder work than
mountain angling, as a gallop over a stiffly enclosed country is
harder than one over an open moor.&nbsp; You can do it or not, as
you like: but if you wish to catch large trout on a bright day, I
should advise you to employ the only method yet discovered.</p>
<p>There&mdash;you are through; and the keeper shall hand you
your rod.&nbsp; You have torn your trousers, and got a couple of
thorns in your shins.&nbsp; The one can be mended, the other
pulled out.&nbsp; Now, jump the feeder.&nbsp; There is no run to
it, so&mdash;you have jumped in.&nbsp; Never mind: but keep the
point of your rod up.&nbsp; You are at least saved the lingering
torture of getting wet inch by inch; and as for cold water
hurting any one&mdash;Credat Jud&aelig;us.</p>
<p>Now make a circuit through the meadow forty yards away.&nbsp;
Stoop down when you are on the ridge of each table.&nbsp; A trout
may be basking at the lower end of the pool, who will see you,
rush up, and tell all his neighbours.&nbsp; Take off that absurd
black chimney-pot, which you are wearing, I suppose, for the same
reason as Homer&rsquo;s heroes wore their koruthous and
phalerous, to make yourself look taller and more terrible to your
foes.&nbsp; Crawl up on three legs; and when you are in position,
kneel down.&nbsp; So.</p>
<p>Shorten your line all you can&mdash;you cannot fish with too
short a line up-stream; and throw, not into the oil-basin near
you, but right up into the darkest corner.&nbsp; Make your fly
strike the brickwork and drop in.&mdash;So?&nbsp; No rise?&nbsp;
Then don&rsquo;t work or draw it, or your deceit is discovered
instantly.&nbsp; Lift it out, and repeat the throw.</p>
<p>What?&nbsp; You have hooked your fly in the hatches?&nbsp;
Very good.&nbsp; Pull at it till the casting-line breaks; put on
a fresh one, and to work again.&nbsp; There! you have him.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t rise! fight him kneeling; hold him hard, and give him
no line, but shorten up anyhow.&nbsp; Tear and haul him down to
you before he can make to his home, while the keeper runs round
with the net . . . There, he is on shore.&nbsp; Two pounds, good
weight.&nbsp; Creep back more cautiously than ever, and try
again. . . . There.&nbsp; A second fish, over a pound
weight.&nbsp; Now we will go and recover the flies off the
hatches; and you will agree that there is more cunning, more
science, and therefore more pleasant excitement, in
&lsquo;foxing&rsquo; a great fish out of a stop-hole, than in
whipping far and wide over an open stream, where a half-pounder
is a wonder and a triumph.&nbsp; As for physical exertion, you
will be able to compute for yourself how much your back, knees,
and fore-arm will ache by nine o&rsquo;clock to-night, after some
ten hours of this scrambling, splashing, leaping, and kneeling
upon a hot June day.&nbsp; This item in the day&rsquo;s work will
of course be put to the side of loss or of gain, according to
your temperament: but it will cure you of an inclination to laugh
at us Wessex chalk-fishers as Cockneys.</p>
<p>So we will wander up the streams, taking a fish here and a
fish there, till&mdash;Really it is very hot.&nbsp; We have the
whole day before us; the fly will not be up till five
o&rsquo;clock at least; and then the real fishing will
begin.&nbsp; Why tire ourselves beforehand?&nbsp; The squire will
send us luncheon in the afternoon, and after that expect us to
fish as long as we can see, and come up to the hall to sleep,
regardless of the ceremony of dressing.&nbsp; For is not the
green drake on?&nbsp; And while he reigns, all hours, meals,
decencies, and respectabilities must yield to his caprice.&nbsp;
See, here he sits, or rather tens of thousands of him, one on
each stalk of grass&mdash;green drake, yellow drake, brown drake,
white drake, each with his gauzy wings folded over his back,
waiting for some unknown change of temperature, or something
else, in the afternoon, to wake him from his sleep, and send him
fluttering over the stream; while overhead the black drake, who
has changed his skin and reproduced his species, dances in the
sunshine, empty, hard, and happy, like Festus Bailey&rsquo;s
Great Black Crow, who all his life sings &lsquo;Ho, ho,
ho,&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;For no one will
eat him,&rsquo; he well doth know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, as we have insides, and he has actually none, and
what is more strange, not even a mouth wherewith to fill the said
insides, we had better copy his brothers and sisters below whose
insides are still left, and settle with them upon the grass
awhile beneath you goodly elm.</p>
<p>Comfort yourself with a glass of sherry and a biscuit, and
give the keeper one, and likewise a cigar.&nbsp; He will value it
at five times its worth, not merely for the pleasure of it, but
because it raises him in the social scale.&nbsp; &lsquo;Any
cad,&rsquo; so he holds, &lsquo;smokes pipes; but a good cigar is
the mark of the quality,&rsquo; and of them who &lsquo;keep
company with the quality,&rsquo; as keepers do.&nbsp; He puts it
in his hat-crown, to smoke this evening in presence of his
compeers at the public-house, retires modestly ten yards, lies
down on his back in a dry feeder, under the shade of the long
grass, and instantly falls fast asleep.&nbsp; Poor fellow! he was
up all last night in the covers, and will be again
to-night.&nbsp; Let him sleep while he may, and we will chat over
chalk-fishing.</p>
<p>The first thing, probably, on which you will be inclined to
ask questions, is the size of the fish in these streams.&nbsp; We
have killed this morning four fish averaging a pound weight
each.&nbsp; All below that weight we throw in, as is our rule
here; but you may have remarked that none of them exceeded half a
pound; that they were almost all about herring size.&nbsp; The
smaller ones I believe to be year-old fish, hatched last spring
twelvemonth; the pound fish two-year-olds.&nbsp; At what rate
these last would have increased depends very much, I suspect, on
their chance of food.&nbsp; The limit of life and growth in
cold-blooded animals seems to depend very much on their amount of
food.&nbsp; The boa, alligator, shark, pike, and I suppose the
trout also, will live to a great age, and attain an enormous
size, give them but range enough; and the only cause why there
are trout of ten pounds and more in the Thames lashers, while one
of four pounds is rare here, is simply that the Thames fish has
more to eat.&nbsp; Here, were the fish not sufficiently thinned
out every year by anglers, they would soon become large-headed,
brown, and flabby, and cease to grow.&nbsp; Many a good stream
has been spoilt in this way, when a squire has unwisely preferred
quantity to quality of fish.</p>
<p>And if it be not the quantity of feed, I know no clear reason
why chalk and limestone trout should be so much larger and better
flavoured than any others.&nbsp; The cause is not the greater
swiftness of the streams; for (paradoxical as it may seem to
many) a trout likes swift water no more than a pike does, except
when spawning or cleaning afterwards.&nbsp; At those times his
blood seems to require a very rapid oxygenation, and he goes to
the &lsquo;sharps&rsquo; to obtain it: but when he is feeding and
fattening, the water cannot be too still for him.&nbsp; Streams
which are rapid throughout never produce large fish; and a
hand-long trout transferred from his native torrent to a still
pond, will increase in size at a ten times faster rate.&nbsp; In
chalk streams the largest fish are found oftener in the
mill-heads than in the mill tails.&nbsp; It is a mistake, though
a common one, to fancy that the giant trout of the Thames lashers
lie in swift water.&nbsp; On the contrary, they lie in the very
stillest spot of the whole pool, which is just under the
hatches.&nbsp; There the rush of the water shoots over their
heads, and they look up through it for every eatable which may be
swept down.&nbsp; At night they run down to the fan of the pool,
to hunt minnow round the shallows; but their home by day is the
still deep; and their preference of the lasher pool to the quiet
water above is due merely to the greater abundance of food.&nbsp;
Chalk trout, then, are large not merely because the water is
swift.</p>
<p>Whether trout have not a specific fondness for lime; whether
water of some dozen degrees of hardness is not necessary for
their development? are questions which may be fairly asked.&nbsp;
Yet is not the true reason this; that the soil on the banks of a
chalk or limestone stream is almost always rich&mdash;red loam,
carrying an abundant vegetation, and therefore an abundant crop
of animal life, both in and out of the water?&nbsp; The countless
insects which haunt a rich hay meadow, all know who have eyes to
see; and if they will look into the stream they will find that
the water-world is even richer than the air-world.</p>
<p>Every still spot in a chalk stream becomes so choked with weed
as to require moving at least thrice a year, to supply the mills
with water.&nbsp; Grass, milfoil, water crowfoot, hornwort,
starwort, horsetail, and a dozen other delicate plants, form one
tangled forest, denser than those of the Amazon, and more densely
peopled likewise.</p>
<p>To this list will soon be added our Transatlantic curse,
<i>Babingtonia diabolica</i>, alias <i>Anacharis alsin
astrum</i>.&nbsp; It has already ascended the Thames as high as
Reading; and a few years more, owing to the present aqua-vivarium
mania, will see it filling every mill-head in England, to the
torment of all millers.&nbsp; Young ladies are assured that the
only plant for their vivariums is a sprig of anacharis, for which
they pay sixpence&mdash;the market value being that of a wasp,
flea, or other scourge of the human race; and when the vivarium
fails, its contents, Anacharis and all, are tost into the nearest
ditch; for which the said young lady ought to be fined five
pounds; and would be, if Governments governed.&nbsp; What an
&lsquo;if&rsquo;.</p>
<p>But come; for the sun burns bright, and fishing is impossible:
lie down upon the bank, above this stop.&nbsp; There is a
campshutting (a boarding in English) on which you can put your
elbows.&nbsp; Lie down on your face, and look down through two or
three feet of water clear as air into the water forest where the
great trout feed.</p>
<p>Here; look into this opening in the milfoil and crowfoot
bed.&nbsp; Do you see a grey film around that sprig?&nbsp;
Examine it through the pocket lens.&nbsp; It is a forest of glass
bells, on branching stalks.&nbsp; They are Vorticell&aelig;; and
every one of those bells, by the ciliary current on its rim, is
scavenging the water&mdash;till a tadpole comes by and scavenges
it.&nbsp; How many millions of living creatures are there on that
one sprig?&nbsp; Look here!&mdash;a brown polype, with long
waving arms&mdash;a gigantic monster, actually a full half-inch
long.&nbsp; He is <i>Hydra fusca</i>, most famous, and earliest
described (I think by Trembley).&nbsp; Ere we go home I may show
you perhaps <i>Hydra viridis</i>, with long pea-green arms; and
<i>rosea</i>, most beautiful in form and colour of all the
strange family.&nbsp; You see that lump, just where his stalk
joins his bell-head?&nbsp; That is a budding baby.&nbsp; Ignorant
of the joys and cares of wedlock, he increases by
gemmation.&nbsp; See! here is another, with a full-sized young
one growing on his back.&nbsp; You may tear it off if you
will&mdash;he cares not.&nbsp; You may cut him into a dozen
pieces, they say, and each one will grow, as a potato does.&nbsp;
I suppose, however, that he also sends out of his mouth little
free ova&mdash;medusoids&mdash;call them what you will, swimming
by cili&aelig;, which afterwards, unless the water beetles stop
them on the way, will settle down as stalked polypes, and in
their turn practise some mystery of Owenian parthenogenesis, or
Steenstruppian alternation of generations, in which all
traditional distinctions of plant and animal, male and female,
are laughed to scorn by the magnificent fecundity of the Divine
imaginations.</p>
<p>That dusty cloud which shakes off in the water as you move the
weed, under the microscope would be one mass of exquisite
forms&mdash;Desmidi&aelig; and Diatomace&aelig;, and what
not?&nbsp; Instead of running over long names, take home a little
in a bottle, put it under your microscope, and if you think good
verify the species from Hassall, Ehrenberg, or other wise book;
but without doing that, one glance through the lens will show you
why the chalk trout grow fat.</p>
<p>Do they, then, eat these infusoria?</p>
<p>That is not clear.&nbsp; But minnows and small fry eat them by
millions; and so do tadpoles, and perhaps caddis baits and water
crickets.</p>
<p>What are they?</p>
<p>Look on the soft muddy bottom.&nbsp; You see numberless bits
of stick.&nbsp; Watch awhile, and those sticks are alive,
crawling and tumbling over each other.&nbsp; The weed, too, is
full of smaller ones.&nbsp; Those live sticks are the larva-cases
of the Caperers&mdash;Phrygane&aelig;&mdash;of which one family
nearly two hundred species have been already found in Great
Britain.&nbsp; Fish up one, and you find, amid sticks and
pebbles, a comfortable silk case, tenanted by a goodly
grub.&nbsp; Six legs he has, like all insects, and tufts of white
horns on each ring of his abdomen, which are his gills.&nbsp; A
goodly pair of jaws he has too, and does good service with them:
for he is the great water scavenger.&nbsp; Decaying vegetable
matter is his food, and with those jaws he will bark a dead stick
as neatly as you will with a penknife.&nbsp; But he does not
refuse animal matter.&nbsp; A dead brother (his, not yours) makes
a savoury meal for him; and a party of those Vorticell&aelig;
would stand a poor chance if he came across them.&nbsp; You may
count these caddis baits by hundreds of thousands; whether the
trout eat them case and all, is a question in these
streams.&nbsp; In some rivers the trout do so; and what is
curious, during the spring, have a regular gizzard, a temporary
thickening of the coats of the stomach, to enable them to grind
the pebbly cases of the caddises.&nbsp; See! here is one whose
house is closed at both ends&mdash;&lsquo;grill&eacute;,&rsquo;
as Pictet calls it, in his unrivalled monograph of the Genevese
Phrygane&aelig;, on which he spent four years of untiring
labour.&nbsp; The grub has stopped the mouth of his case by an
open network of silk, defended by small pebbles, through which
the water may pass freely, while he changes into his nymph
state.&nbsp; Open the case; you find within not a grub, but a
strange bird-beaked creature, with long legs and horns laid flat
by its sides, and miniature wings on its back.&nbsp; Observe that
the sides of the tail, and one pair of legs, are fringed with
dark hairs.&nbsp; After a fortnight&rsquo;s rest in this prison
this &lsquo;nymph&rsquo; will gnaw her way out and swim through
the water on her back, by means of that fringed tail and paddles,
till she reaches the bank and the upper air.&nbsp; There, under
the genial light of day, her skin will burst, and a four-winged
fly emerge, to buzz over the water as a fawn-coloured
Caperer&mdash;deadliest of trout flies; if she be not snapped up
beforehand under water by some spotted monarch in search of
supper.</p>
<p>But look again among this tangled mass of weed.&nbsp; Here are
more larv&aelig; of water-flies.&nbsp; Some have the sides
fringed with what look like paddles, but are gills.&nbsp; Of
these one part have whisks at the tail, and swim freely.&nbsp;
They will change into ephemer&aelig;, cock-winged
&lsquo;duns,&rsquo; with long whisked tails.&nbsp; The
larv&aelig; of the famous green drake (<i>Ephemera vulgata</i>)
are like these: but we shall not find them.&nbsp; They are all
changed by now into the perfect fly; and if not, they burrow
about the banks, and haunt the crayfish-holes, and are not easily
found.</p>
<p>Some, again, have the gills on their sides larger and broader,
and no whisks at the tail.&nbsp; These are the larv&aelig; of
Sialis, the black alder, Lord Stowell&rsquo;s fly, shorm fly,
hunch-back of the Welsh, with which we have caught our best fish
to-day.</p>
<p>And here is one of a delicate yellow-green, whose tail is
furnished with three broad paddle-blades.&nbsp; These, I believe,
are gills again.&nbsp; The larva is probably that of the Yellow
Sally&mdash;<i>Chrysoperla viridis</i>&mdash;a famous fly on hot
days in May and June.&nbsp; Among the pebbles there, below the
fall, we should have found, a month since, a similar but much
larger grub, with two paddles at his tail.&nbsp; He is the
&lsquo;creeper&rsquo; of the northern streams, and changes to the
great crawling stone fly (May-fly of Tweed), <i>Perla
bicaudata</i>, an ugly creature, which runs on stones and posts,
and kills right well on stormy days, when he is beaten into the
stream.</p>
<p>There.&nbsp; Now we have the larv&aelig; of the four great
trout-fly families, Phrygane&aelig;, Ephemer&aelig;,
Sialid&aelig;, Perlid&aelig;; so you have no excuse for
telling&mdash;as not only Cockneys, but really good sportsmen who
write on fishing, have done&mdash;such fibs as that the green
drake comes out of a caddis-bait, or giving such vague
generalities as, &lsquo;this fly comes from a
water-larva.&rsquo;</p>
<p>These are, surely, in their imperfect and perfect states, food
enough to fatten many a good trout: but they are not all.&nbsp;
See these transparent brown snails, Limne&aelig; and
Succin&aelig;, climbing about the posts; and these other pretty
ones, coil laid within coil as flat as a shilling,
Planorbis.&nbsp; Many a million of these do the trout pick off
the weed day by day; and no food, not even the leech, which
swarms here, is more fattening.&nbsp; The finest trout of the
high Snowdon lakes feed almost entirely on leech and
snail&mdash;baits they have none&mdash;and fatten till they cut
as red as a salmon.</p>
<p>Look here too, once more.&nbsp; You see a grey moving cloud
about that pebble bed, and underneath that bank.&nbsp; It is a
countless swarm of &lsquo;sug,&rsquo; or water-shrimp; a bad
food, but devoured greedily by the great trout in certain
overstocked preserves.</p>
<p>Add to these plenty of minnow, stone-loach, and miller&rsquo;s
thumbs, a second course of young crayfish, and for one
gormandizing week of bliss, thousands of the great green-drake
fly: and you have food enough for a stock of trout which
surprise, by their size and number, an angler fresh from the
mountain districts of the north and west.&nbsp; To such a
fisherman, the tale of Mr. ** *, of Ramsbury, who is said to have
killed in one day in his own streams on Kennet, seventy-six
trout, all above a pound, sounds like a traveller&rsquo;s
imagination: yet the fact is, I believe, accurately true.</p>
<p>This, however, is an extraordinary case upon an extraordinary
stream.&nbsp; In general, if a man shall bring home (beside small
fish) a couple of brace of from one to three pounds apiece, he
may consider himself as a happy man, and that the heavens have
not shone, but frowned, upon him very propitiously.</p>
<p>And now comes another and an important question.&nbsp; For
which of all these dainty eatables, if for any, do the trout take
our flies? and from that arises another.&nbsp; Why are the flies
with which we have been fishing this morning so large&mdash;of
the size which is usually employed on a Scotch lake?&nbsp; You
are a North-country fisher, and are wont, upon your clear
streams, to fish with nothing but the smallest gnats.&nbsp; And
yet our streams are as clear as yours: what can be clearer?</p>
<p>Whether fish really mistake our artificial flies for different
species of natural ones, as Englishmen hold; or merely for
something good to eat, the colour whereof strikes their fancy, as
Scotchmen think&mdash;a theory which has been stated in detail,
and with great semblance of truth, in Mr. Stewart&rsquo;s
admirable &lsquo;Practical Angler,&rsquo;&mdash;is a matter about
which much good sense has been written on both sides.</p>
<p>Whosoever will, may find the great controversy fully discussed
in the pages of Ephemera.&nbsp; Perhaps (as in most cases) the
truth lies between the two extremes; at least, in a
chalk-stream.</p>
<p>Ephemera&rsquo;s list of flies may be very excellent, but it
is about ten times as long as would be required for any of our
southern streams.&nbsp; Six or seven sort of flies ought to
suffice for any fisherman; if they will not kill, the thing which
will kill is yet to seek.</p>
<p>To name them:&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The caperer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; The March-brown.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; The governor.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The black alder.</p>
<p>And two or three large palmers, red, grizzled, and
coch-a-bonddhu, each with a tuft of red floss silk at the
tail.&nbsp; These are enough to show sport from March to October;
and also like enough to certain natural flies to satisfy the
somewhat dull memory of a trout.</p>
<p>But beyond this list there is little use in roaming, as far as
my experience goes.&nbsp; A yellow dun kills sometimes
marvellously on chalk-streams, and always upon rocky ones.&nbsp;
A Turkey-brown ephemera, the wing made of the bright brown tail
of the cock partridge, will, even just after the May-fly is off,
show good sport in the forenoon, when he is on the water; and so
will in the evening the claret spinner, to which he turns.&nbsp;
Excellent patterns of these flies may be found in Ronalds: but,
after all, they are uncertain flies; and, as Harry Verney used to
say, &lsquo;they casualty flies be all havers;&rsquo; which
sentence the reader, if he understands good Wessex, can doubtless
translate for himself.</p>
<p>And there are evenings on which the fish take greedily small
transparent ephemer&aelig;.&nbsp; But, did you ever see large
fish rise at these ephemer&aelig;?&nbsp; And even if you did, can
you imitate the natural fly?&nbsp; And after all, would it not be
waste of time?&nbsp; For the experience of many good fishers is,
that trout rise at these delicate duns, black gnats, and other
microscopic trash, simply <i>faute de mieux</i>.&nbsp; They are
hungry, as trout are six days in the week, just at sunset.&nbsp;
A supper they must have, and they take what comes; but if you can
give them anything better than the minute fairy, compact of equal
parts of glass and wind, which naturalists call an Ephemera or
B&aelig;tis, it will be most thankfully received, if there be
ripple enough on the water (which there seldom is on a fine
evening) to hide the line: and even though the water be still,
take boldly your caperer or your white moth (either of them ten
times as large as what the trout are rising at), hurl it boldly
into a likely place, and let it lie quiet and sink, not
attempting to draw or work it; and if you do not catch anything
by that means, comfort yourself with the thought that there are
others who can.</p>
<p>And now to go through our list, beginning with&mdash;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; The caperer.</p>
<p>This perhaps is the best of all flies; it is certainly the one
which will kill earliest and latest in the year; and though I
would hardly go as far as a friend of mine, who boasts of never
fishing with anything else, I believe it will, from March to
October, take more trout, and possibly more grayling, than any
other fly.&nbsp; Its basis is the woodcock wing; red hackle legs,
which should be long and pale; and a thin mohair body, of
different shades of red-brown, from a dark claret to a pale
sandy.&nbsp; It may thus, tied of different sizes, do duty for
half-a-dozen of the commonest flies; for the early claret
(red-brown of Ronalds; a Nemoura, according to him), which is the
first spring-fly; for the red spinner, or perfect form of the
March-brown ephemera; for the soldier, the soft-winged reddish
beetle which haunts the umbelliferous flowers, and being as soft
in spirit as in flesh, perpetually falls into the water, and
comes to grief therein; and last but not least, for the true
caperers, or whole tribe of Phryganid&aelig;, of which a sketch
was given just now.&nbsp; As a copy of them, the body should be
of a pale red brown, all but sandy (but never snuff-coloured, as
shop-girls often tie it), and its best hour is always in the
evening.&nbsp; It kills well when fish are gorged with their
morning meal of green drakes; and after the green drake is off,
it is almost the only fly at which large trout care to look; a
fact not to be wondered at when one considers that nearly two
hundred species of English Phryganid&aelig; have been already
described, and that at least half of them are of the fawn-tint of
the caperer.&nbsp; Under the title of flame-brown, cinnamon, or
red-hackle and rail&rsquo;s wing, a similar fly kills well in
Ireland, and in Scotland also; and is sometimes the best
sea-trout fly which can be laid on the water.&nbsp; Let this
suffice for the caperer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Of the March-brown ephemera there is little to be
said, save to notice Ronalds&rsquo; and Ephemera&rsquo;s
excellent description, and Ephemera&rsquo;s good hint of fishing
with more than one March-brown at once, viz., with a sandy-bodied
male, and a greenish-bodied female.&nbsp; The fly is a worthy
fly, and being easily imitated, gives great sport, in number
rather than in size; for when the March-brown is out, the two or
three pound fish are seldom on the move, preferring leeches,
tom-toddies, and caddis-bait in the nether deeps, to slim
ephemer&aelig; at the top; and if you should (as you may) get
hold of a big fish on the fly, &lsquo;you&rsquo;d best hit him in
again,&rsquo; as we say in Wessex; for he will be, like the
Ancient Mariner&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Long, and lank, and
brown,<br />
As is the ribbed sea-sand.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>3.&nbsp; The &lsquo;governor.&rsquo;&mdash;In most sandy
banks, and dry poor lawns, will be found numberless burrows of
ground bees who have a great trick of tumbling into the
water.&nbsp; Perhaps, like the honey bee, they are thirsty souls,
and must needs go down to the river and drink; perhaps, like the
honey bee, they rise into the air with some difficulty, and so in
crossing a stream are apt to strike the further bank, and fall
in.&nbsp; Be that as it may, an imitation of these little ground
bees is a deadly fly the whole year round; and if worked within
six inches of the shore, will sometimes fill a basket when there
is not a fly on the water or a fish rising.&nbsp; There are those
who never put up a cast of flies without one; and those, too, who
have killed large salmon on him in the north of Scotland, when
the streams are low.</p>
<p>His tie is simple enough.&nbsp; A pale partridge or woodcock
wing, short red hackle legs, a peacock-herl body, and a
tail&mdash;on which too much artistic skill can hardly be
expended&mdash;of yellow floss silk, and gold twist or
tinsel.&nbsp; The orange-tailed governors &lsquo;of ye
shops,&rsquo; as the old drug-books would say, are all
&lsquo;havers;&rsquo; for the proper colour is a honey
yellow.&nbsp; The mystery of this all-conquering tail seems to
be, that it represents the yellow pollen, or &lsquo;bee
bread&rsquo; in the thighs or abdomen of the bee; whereof the
bright colour, and perhaps the strong musky flavour, makes him an
attractive and savoury morsel.&nbsp; Be that as it may, there is
no better rule for a chalk stream than this&mdash;when you
don&rsquo;t know what to fish with, try the governor.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; The black alder (<i>Sialis nigra</i>, or
<i>Lutaria</i>).</p>
<p>What shall be said, or not be said, of this queen of
flies?&nbsp; And what of Ephemera, who never mentions her?&nbsp;
His alder fly is&mdash;I know not what; certainly not that black
alder, shorm fly, Lord Stowell&rsquo;s fly, or hunch-back, which
kills the monsters of the deep, surpassed only by the green drake
for one fortnight; but surpassing him in this, that she will kill
on till September, from that happy day on which</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;You find her out on every stalk<br />
Whene&rsquo;er you take a river walk,<br />
When swifts at eve begin to hawk.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O thou beloved member of the brute creation!&nbsp; Songs have
been written in praise of thee; statues would ere now have been
erected to thee, had that hunch back and those flabby wings of
thine been &lsquo;susceptible of artistic treatment.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But ugly thou art in the eyes of the uninitiated vulgar; a little
stumpy old maid toddling about the world in a black bonnet and a
brown cloak, laughed at by naughty boys, but doing good wherever
thou comest, and leaving sweet memories behind thee; so sweet
that the trout will rise at the ghost or sham of thee, for pure
love of thy past kindnesses to them, months after thou hast
departed from this sublunary sphere.&nbsp; What hours of bliss do
I not owe to thee!&nbsp; How have I seen, in the rich meads of
Wey, after picking out wretched quarter-pounders all the morning
on March-brown and red-hackle, the great trout rush from every
hover to welcome thy first appearance among the sedges and
buttercups!&nbsp; How often, late in August, on Thames, on Test,
on Loddon heads, have I seen the three and four pound fish prefer
thy dead image to any live reality.&nbsp; Have I not seen poor
old Si. Wilder, king of Thames fishermen (now gone home to his
rest), shaking his huge sides with delight over thy mighty deeds,
as his fourteen-inch whiskers fluttered in the breeze like the
horsetail standard of some great Bashaw, while crystal Thames
murmured over the white flints on Monkey Island shallow, and the
soft breeze sighed in the colossal poplar spires, and the great
trout rose and rose, and would not cease, at thee, my
alder-fly?&nbsp; Have I not seen, after a day in which the earth
below was iron, and the heavens above as brass, as the
three-pounders would have thee, and thee alone, in the purple
August dusk, old Moody&rsquo;s red face grow redder with
excitement, half proud at having advised me to &lsquo;put
on&rsquo; thee, half fearful lest we should catch all my
lady&rsquo;s pet trout in one evening?&nbsp; Beloved alder-fly!
would that I could give thee a soul (if indeed thou hast not one
already, thou, and all things which live), and make thee happy in
all &aelig;ons to come!&nbsp; But as it is, such immortality as I
can I bestow on thee here, in small return for all the pleasant
days thou hast bestowed on me.</p>
<p>Bah!&nbsp; I am becoming poetical; let us think how to tie an
alder-fly.</p>
<p>The common tie is good enough.&nbsp; A brown mallard, or dark
hen-pheasant tail for wing, a black hackle for legs, and the
necessary peacock-herl body.&nbsp; A better still is that of
Jones Jones Beddgelert, the famous fishing clerk of Snowdonia,
who makes the wing of dappled peacock-hen, and puts the black
hackle on before the wings, in order to give the peculiar
hunch-backed shape of the natural fly.&nbsp; Many a good fish has
this tie killed.&nbsp; But the best pattern of all is tied from
the mottled wing-feather of an Indian bustard; generally used,
when it can be obtained, only for salmon flies.&nbsp; The brown
and fawn check pattern of this feather seems to be peculiarly
tempting to trout, especially to the large trout of Thames; and
in every river where I have tried the alder, I have found the
bustard wing <i>facile princeps</i> among all patterns of the
fly.</p>
<p>Of palmers (the hairy caterpillars) are many sorts.&nbsp;
Ephemera gives by far the best list yet published.&nbsp; Ronalds
has also three good ones, but whether they are really taken by
trout instead of the particular natural insects which he
mentions, is not very certain.&nbsp; The little coch-a-bonddhu
palmer, so killing upon moor streams, may probably be taken for
young larv&aelig; of the fox and oak-egger moths, abundant on all
moors, upon trefoils, and other common plants; but the lowland
caterpillars are so abundant and so various in colour that trout
must be good entomologists to distinguish them.&nbsp; Some
distinction they certainly make; for one palmer will kill where
another does not: but this depends a good deal on the colour of
the water; the red palmer, being easily seen, will kill almost
anywhere and any when, simply because it is easily seen; and both
the grizzle and brown palmer may be made to kill by adding to the
tail a tuft of red floss silk; for red, it would seem, has the
same exciting effect on fish which it has upon many quadrupeds,
possibly because it is the colour of flesh.&nbsp; The mackerel
will often run greedily at a strip of scarlet cloth; and the most
killing pike-fly I ever used had a body made of remnants of the
huntsman&rsquo;s new &lsquo;pink.&rsquo;&nbsp; Still, there are
local palmers.&nbsp; On Thames, for instance, I have seldom
failed with the grizzled palmer, while the brown has seldom
succeeded, and the usually infallible red never.&nbsp; There is
one more palmer worth trying, which Scotsmen, I believe, call the
Royal Charlie; a coch-a-bonddhu or furnace hackle, over a body of
gold-coloured floss silk, ribbed with broad gold tinsel.&nbsp;
Both in Devonshire and in Hampshire this will kill great
quantities of fish, wherever furzy or otherwise wild banks or
oak-woods afford food for the oak-egger and fox moths, which
children call &lsquo;Devil&rsquo;s Gold Rings,&rsquo; and
Scotsmen &lsquo;Hairy Oubits.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Two hints more about palmers.&nbsp; They must not be worked on
the top of the water, but used as stretchers, and allowed to sink
as living caterpillars do; and next, they can hardly be too large
or rough, provided that you have skill enough to get them into
the water without a splash.&nbsp; I have killed well on Thames
with one full three inches long, armed of course with two small
hooks.&nbsp; With palmers&mdash;and perhaps with all
baits&mdash;the rule is, the bigger the bait the bigger the
fish.&nbsp; A large fish does not care to move except for a good
mouthful.&nbsp; The best pike-fisher I know prefers a half-pound
chub when he goes after one of his fifteen-pound jack; and the
largest pike I ever ran&mdash;and lost, alas!&mdash;who seemed of
any weight above twenty pounds, was hooked on a live white fish
of full three-quarters of a pound.&nbsp; Still, no good angler
will despise the minute North-country flies.&nbsp; In Yorkshire
they are said to kill the large chalk trout of Driffield as well
as the small limestone and grit fish of Craven; if so, the
gentlemen of the Driffield Club, who are said to think nothing of
killing three-pound fish on midge flies and cobweb tackle, must
be (as canny Yorkshiremen are likely enough to be) the best
anglers in England.</p>
<p>In one spot only in Yorkshire, as far as I know, do our large
chalk flies kill: namely, in the lofty limestone tarn of
Malham.&nbsp; There palmers, caperers, and rough black flies, of
the largest Thames and Kennet sizes, seem the only attractive
baits: and for this reason, that they are the flies of the
place.&nbsp; The cinnamon Phryganea comes up abundantly from
among the stones; and the large peat moss to the west of the tarn
abounds, as usual, in house-flies and bluebottles, and in the
caterpillars of the fox and oak-egger moths: another proof that
the most attractive flies are imitations of the real
insects.&nbsp; On the other hand, there are said to be times when
midges, and nothing else, will rise fish on some chalk
streams.&nbsp; The delicate black hackle which Mr. Stewart
praises so highly (and which should always be tied on a square
sneck-bend hook) will kill in June and July; and on the Itchen,
at Winchester, hardly any flies but small ones are used after the
green drake is off.&nbsp; But there is one sad objection against
these said midges&mdash;what becomes of your fish when hooked on
one in a stream full of weeds (as all chalk streams are after
June), save</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;One struggle more, and I am free<br />
From pangs which rend my heart in twain&rsquo;?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Winchester fishers have confessed to me that they lose three
good fish out of every four in such cases; and as it seems pretty
clear that chalk fish approve of no medium between very large
flies and very small ones, I advise the young angler, whose
temper is not yet schooled into perfect resignation, to spare his
own feelings by fishing with a single large fly&mdash;say the
governor in the forenoon, the caperer in the evening, regardless
of the clearness of the water.&nbsp; I have seen flies large
enough for April, raise fish excellently in Test and other clear
streams in July and August; and, what is more, drag them up out
of the weeds and into the landing-net, where midges would have
lost them in the first scuffle.</p>
<p>So much for our leading chalk flies; all copies of live
insects.&nbsp; Of the entomology of mountain streams little as
yet is known: but a few scattered hints may suffice to show that
in them, as well as in the chalk rivers, a little natural science
might help the angler.</p>
<p>The well-known fact that smaller flies are required on the
moors than in the lowlands, is easily explained by the fact that
poorer soils and swifter streams produce smaller insects.&nbsp;
The large Phrygane&aelig;, or true caperers, whose caddis-baits
love still pools and stagnant ditches, are there rare; and the
office of water-scavenger is fulfilled by the Rhyacophiles
(torrent-lovers) and Hydropsyches, whose tiny pebble-houses are
fixed to the stones to resist the violence of the summer
floods.&nbsp; In and out of them the tiny larva runs to find
food, making in addition, in some species, galleries of earth
along the surface of the stones, in which he takes his walks
abroad in full security.&nbsp; In any of the brown rivulets of
Windsor forest, towards the middle of summer, the pebble-houses
of these little creatures may be seen in millions, studding every
stone.&nbsp; To the Hydropsyches (species <i>montana</i>? or
<i>variegata</i>? of Pictet) belongs that curious little Welsh
fly, known in Snowdon by the name of the Gwynnant, whose
tesselated wing is best imitated by brown mallard feather, and
who so swarms in the lower lakes of Snowdon, that it is often
necessary to use three of them on the line at once, all other
flies being useless.&nbsp; It is perhaps the abundance of these
tesselated Hydropsyches which makes the mallard wing the most
useful in mountain districts, as the abundance of the fawn and
grey Phryganid&aelig; in the south of England makes the woodcock
wing justly the favourite.&nbsp; The Rhyacophiles, on the other
hand, are mostly of a shining soot-grey, or almost black.&nbsp;
These may be seen buzzing in hundreds over the pools on a wet
evening, and with them the sooty Mystacides, called silverhorns
in Scotland, from their antenn&aelig;, which are of preposterous
length, and ringed prettily enough with black and white.&nbsp;
These delicate fairies make moveable cases, or rather pipes, of
the finest sand, generally curved, and resembling in shape the
Dentalium shell.&nbsp; Guarded by these, they hang in myriads on
the smooth ledges of rock, where the water runs gently a few
inches deep.&nbsp; These are abundant everywhere: but I never saw
so many of them as in the exquisite Cother brook, near Middleham,
in Yorkshire.&nbsp; In that delicious glen, while wading up
beneath the ash-fringed crags of limestone, out of which the
great ring ouzel (too wild, it seemed, to be afraid of man)
hopped down fearlessly to feed upon the strand, or past
flower-banks where the golden globe-flower, and the great blue
geranium, and the giant campanula bloomed beneath the white
tassels of the bird-cherry, I could not tread upon the limestone
slabs without crushing at every step hundreds of the delicate
Mystacide tubes, which literally paved the shallow edge of the
stream, and which would have been metamorphosed in due time into
small sooty moth-like fairies, best represented, I should say, by
the soft black-hackle which Mr. Stewart recommends as the most
deadly of North-country flies.&nbsp; Not to these, however, but
to the Phrygane&aelig; (who, when sticks and pebbles fail, often
make their tubes of sand, e.g. <i>P. flava</i>), should I refer
the red-cow fly, which is almost the only autumn killer in the
Dartmoor streams.&nbsp; A red cowhair body and a woodcock wing is
his type, and let those who want West-country trout remember
him.</p>
<p>Another fly, common on some rocky streams, but more scarce in
the chalk, is the &lsquo;Yellow Sally,&rsquo; which
entomologists, with truer appreciation of its colour, call
<i>Chrysoperla viridis</i>.&nbsp; It may be bought at the shops;
at least a yellow something of that name, but bearing no more
resemblance to the delicate yellow-green natural fly, with its
warm grey wings, than a Pre-Raphaelite portrait to the human
being for whom it is meant.&nbsp; Copied, like most trout flies,
from some traditional copy by the hands of Cockney maidens, who
never saw a fly in their lives, the mistake of a mistake, a sham
raised to its tenth power, it stands a signal proof that anglers
will never get good flies till they learn a little entomology
themselves, and then teach it to the tackle makers.&nbsp; But if
it cannot be bought, it can at least be made; and I should advise
everyone who fishes rocky streams in May and June, to dye for
himself some hackles of a brilliant greenish-yellow, and in the
most burning sunshine, when fish seem inclined to rise at no fly
whatsoever, examine the boulders for the Chrysoperla, who runs
over them, her wings laid flat on her back, her yellow legs
moving as rapidly as a forest-fly&rsquo;s; try to imitate her,
and use her on the stream, or on the nearest lake.&nbsp; Certain
it is that in Snowdon this fly and the Gwynnant Hydropsyche will
fill a creel in the most burning north-easter, when all other
flies are useless; a sufficient disproof of the Scotch
theory&mdash;that fish do not prefer the fly which is on the
water. <a name="citation74"></a><a href="#footnote74"
class="citation">[74]</a></p>
<p>Another disproof may be found in the &lsquo;fern web,&rsquo;
&lsquo;bracken clock&rsquo; of Scotland; the tiny cockchafer,
with brown wing-cases and dark-green thorax, which abounds in
some years in the hay-meadows, on the fern, or on the heads of
umbelliferous flowers.&nbsp; The famous Loch-Awe fly, described
as an alder-fly with a rail&rsquo;s wing, seems to be nothing but
this fat little worthy: but the best plan is to make the wings,
either buzz or hackle, of the bright neck-feather of the cock
pheasant, thus gaining the metallic lustre of the beetle
tribe.&nbsp; Tied thus, either in Devonshire or Snowdon, few
flies surpass him when he is out.&nbsp; His fatness proves an
attraction which the largest fish cannot resist.</p>
<p>The Ephemer&aelig;, too, are far more important in rapid and
rocky streams than in the deeper, stiller waters of the
south.&nbsp; It is worth while for a good fish to rise at them
there; the more luxurious chalk trout will seldom waste himself
upon them, unless he be lying in shallow water, and has but to
move a few inches upward.</p>
<p>But these Ephemer&aelig;, like all other naiads, want working
out.&nbsp; The species which Mr. Ronalds gives, are most of them,
by his own confession, very uncertain.&nbsp; Of the
Phryganid&aelig; he seems to know little or nothing, mentioning
but two species out of the two hundred which are said to inhabit
Britain; and his land flies and beetles are in several cases
quite wrongly named.&nbsp; However, the professed entomologists
know but little of the mountain flies; and the angler who would
help to work them out would confer a benefit on science, as well
as on the &lsquo;gentle craft.&rsquo;&nbsp; As yet the only
approach to such a good work which I know of, is a little book on
the trout flies of Ripon, with excellent engravings of the
natural fly.&nbsp; The author&rsquo;s name is not given; but the
book may be got at Ripon, and most valuable it must be to any
North-country fisherman.</p>
<p>But come, we must not waste our time in talk, for here is a
cloud over the sun, and plenty more coming up behind, before a
ruffling south-west breeze, as Shelley has it&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Calling white
clouds like flocks to feed in air.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us up and onward to that long still reach, which is now
curling up fast before the breeze; there are large fish to be
taken, one or two at least, even before the fly comes on.&nbsp;
You need not change your flies; the cast which you have
on&mdash;governor, and black alder&mdash;will take, if anything
will.&nbsp; Only do not waste your time and muscle, as you are
beginning to do, by hurling your flies wildly into the middle of
the stream, on the chance of a fish being there.&nbsp; Fish are
there, no doubt, but not feeding ones.&nbsp; They are sailing
about and enjoying the warmth; but nothing more.&nbsp; If you
want to find the hungry fish and to kill them, you must stand
well back from the bank&mdash;or kneel down, if you are really in
earnest about sport; and throw within a foot of the shore, above
you or below (but if possible above), with a line short enough to
manage easily; by which I mean short enough to enable you to lift
your flies out of the water at each throw without hooking them in
the docks and comfrey which grow along the brink.&nbsp; You must
learn to raise your hand at the end of each throw, and lift the
flies clean over the land-weeds: or you will lose time, and
frighten all the fish, by crawling to the bank to unhook
them.&nbsp; Believe me, one of the commonest mistakes into which
young anglers fall is that of fishing in &lsquo;skipjack
broad;&rsquo; in plain English, in mid-stream, where few fish,
and those little ones, are to be caught.&nbsp; Those who wish for
large fish work close under the banks, and seldom take a
mid-stream cast, unless they see a fish rise there.</p>
<p>The reason of this is simple.&nbsp; Walking up the Strand in
search of a dinner, a reasonable man will keep to the trottoir,
and look in at the windows close to him, instead of parading up
the mid-street.&nbsp; And even so do all wise and ancient
trout.&nbsp; The banks are their shops; and thither they go for
their dinners, driving their poor little children tyrannously out
into the mid-river to fare as hap may hap.&nbsp; Over these
children the tyro wastes his time, flogging the stream across and
across for weary hours, while the big papas and mammas are
comfortably under the bank, close at his feet, grubbing about the
sides for water crickets, and not refusing at times a leech or a
young crayfish, but perfectly ready to take a fly if you offer
one large and tempting enough.&nbsp; They do but act on
experience.&nbsp; All the largest surface-food&mdash;beetles,
bees, and palmers&mdash;comes off the shore; and all the caperers
and alders, after emerging from their pupa-cases, swim to the
shore in order to change into the perfect insect in the open
air.&nbsp; The perfect insects haunt sunny sedges and
tree-stems&mdash;whence the one is often called the sedge, the
other the alder-fly&mdash;and from thence drop into the
trouts&rsquo; mouths; and within six inches of the bank will the
good angler work, all the more sedulously and even hopefully if
he sees no fish rising.&nbsp; I have known good men say that they
had rather <i>not</i> see fish on the rise, if the day be good;
that they can get surer sport, and are less troubled with small
fish, by making them rise; and certain it is, that a day when the
fish are rising all over the stream is generally one of
disappointment.</p>
<p>Another advantage of bank fishing is, that the fish sees the
fly only for a moment.&nbsp; He has no long gaze at it, as it
comes to him across the water.&nbsp; It either drops exactly over
his nose, or sweeps down the stream straight upon him.&nbsp; He
expects it to escape on shore the next moment, and chops at it
fiercely and hastily, instead of following and examining.&nbsp;
Add to this the fact that when he is under the bank there is far
less chance of his seeing you; and duly considering these things,
you will throw away no more time in drawing, at least in
chalk-streams, flies over the watery wastes, to be snapped at now
and then by herring-sized pinkeens.&nbsp; In rocky streams, where
the quantity of bank food is far smaller, this rule will perhaps
not hold good; though who knows not that his best fish are
generally taken under some tree from which the little
caterpillars, having determined on slow and deliberate suicide
are letting themselves down gently by a silken thread into the
mouth of the spotted monarch, who has but to sail about and
about, and pick them up one by one as they touch the
stream?&mdash;A sight which makes one think&mdash;as does a herd
of swine crunching acorns, each one of which might have become a
&lsquo;builder oak&rsquo;&mdash;how Nature is never more
magnificent than in her waste.</p>
<p>The next mistake, natural enough to the laziness of fallen
man, is that of fishing down-stream, and not up.&nbsp; What Mr.
Stewart says on this point should be read by every tyro.&nbsp; By
fishing up-stream, even against the wind, he will on an average
kill twice as many trout as when fishing down.&nbsp; If trout are
out and feeding on the shallows, up or down will simply make the
difference of fish or no fish; and even in deeps, where the
difference in the chance of not being seen is not so great, many
more fish will be hooked by the man who fishes up-stream, simply
because when he strikes he pulls the hook into the trout&rsquo;s
mouth instead of out of it.&nbsp; But he who would obey Mr.
Stewart in fishing up-stream must obey him also in discarding his
light London rod, which is in three cases out of four as weak and
&lsquo;floppy&rsquo; in the middle as a waggon whip, and get to
himself a stiff and powerful rod, strong enough to spin a minnow;
whereby he will obtain, after some weeks of aching muscles, two
good things&mdash;a fore-arm fit for a sculptor&rsquo;s model,
and trout hooked and killed, instead of pricked and lost.</p>
<p>Killed, as well as hooked; for how large trout are to be
killed in a weedy chalk-stream without a stiff rod which will
take them down, is a question yet unsolved.&nbsp; Even the merest
Cockney will know, if he thinks, that weeds float with their
points down-stream; and that therefore if a fish is to be brought
through them without entangling, he must be &lsquo;combed&rsquo;
through them in the same direction.&nbsp; But how is this to be
done, if a fish be hooked below you on a weak rod?&nbsp; With a
strong rod indeed you can, at the chance of tearing out the hook,
keep him by main force on the top of the water, till you have run
past him and below him, shortening your line anyhow in
loops&mdash;there is no time to wind it up with the
reel&mdash;and then do what you might have done comfortably at
first had you been fishing up&mdash;viz., bring him down-stream,
and let the water run through his gills, and drown him.&nbsp; But
with a weak rod&mdash;Alas for the tyro!&nbsp; He catches one
glimpse of a silver side plunging into the depths; he finds his
rod double in his hand; he finds fish and flies stop suddenly
somewhere; he rushes down to the spot, sees weeds waving around
his line, and guesses from what he feels and sees that the fish
is grubbing up-stream through them, five feet under water.&nbsp;
He tugs downwards and backwards, but too late; the drop-fly is
fast wrapt in Ceratophyllum and Glyceria, Callitriche and
Potamogeton, and half-a-dozen more horrid things with long names
and longer stems; and what remains but the fate of
Campbell&rsquo;s Lord Ullin?&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The waters wild went o&rsquo;er his
child,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he was left lamenting.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unless, in fact, large fish can be got rapidly down-stream,
the chance of killing them is very small; and therefore the man
who fishes a willow-fringed brook downward, is worthy of no crown
but Ophelia&rsquo;s, besides being likely enough, if he attempt
to get down to his fish, to share her fate.&nbsp; The best
fisherman, however, will come to shame in streams bordered by
pollard willows, and among queer nooks, which can be only fished
down-stream.&nbsp; I saw, but the other day, a fish hooked
cleverly enough, by throwing to an inch where he ought to have
been, and indeed was, and from the only point whence the throw
could be made.&nbsp; Out of the water he came, head and tail, the
moment he felt the hook, and showed a fair side over two pounds
weight . . . . and then?&nbsp; Instead of running away, he ran
right at the fisherman, for reasons which were but too
patent.&nbsp; Between man and fish were ten yards of shallow,
then a deep weedy shelf, and then the hole which was his
house.&nbsp; And for that weedy shelf the spotted monarch made,
knowing that there he could drag himself clear of the fly, as
perhaps he had done more than once before.</p>
<p>What was to be done?&nbsp; Take him down-stream through the
weed?&nbsp; Alas, on the man&rsquo;s left hand an old pollard
leant into the water, barring all downward movement.&nbsp; Jump
in and run round?&nbsp; He had rather to run back from the bank,
from fear of a loose line; the fish was coming at him so fast
that there was no time to wind up.&nbsp; Safe into the weeds
hurls the fish; the man, as soon as he finds the fish stop, jumps
in mid-leg deep, and staggers up to him, in hopes of clearing;
finds the dropper fast in the weeds, and the stretcher, which had
been in the fish&rsquo;s mouth, wantoning somewhere in the
depths&mdash;<i>Quid plura</i>?&nbsp; Let us draw a veil over
that man&rsquo;s return to shore.</p>
<p>No mortal skill could have killed that fish.&nbsp; Mortal luck
(which is sometimes, as most statesmen know, very great) might
have done it, if the fish had been irretrievably fast hooked; as,
per contra, I once saw a fish of nearly four pounds hooked just
above an alder bush, on the same bank as the angler.&nbsp; The
stream was swift: there was a great weed-bed above; the man had
but about ten feet square of swift water to kill the trout
in.&nbsp; Not a foot down-stream could he take him; in fact, he
had to pull him hard up-stream to keep him out of his hover in
the alder roots.&nbsp; Three times that fish leapt into the air
nearly a yard high; and yet, so merciful is luck, and so firmly
was he hooked, in five breathless minutes he was in the
landing-net; and when he was there and safe ashore, just of the
shape and colour of a silver spoon, his captor lay down panting
upon the bank, and with Sir Hugh Evans, manifested &lsquo;a great
disposition to cry.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it was a beautiful
sight.&nbsp; A sharper round between man and fish never saw I
fought in Merry England.</p>
<p>I saw once, however, a cleverer, though not a more dashing
feat.&nbsp; A handy little fellow (I wonder where he is now?)
hooked a trout of nearly three pounds with his dropper, and at
the same moment a post with his stretcher.&nbsp; What was to be
done?&nbsp; To keep the fish pulling on him, and not on the
post.&nbsp; And that, being favoured by standing on a four-foot
bank, he did so well that he tired out the fish in some six feet
square of water, stopping him and turning him beautifully
whenever he tried to run, till I could get in to him with the
landing-net.&nbsp; That was five-and-thirty years since.&nbsp; If
the little man has progressed in his fishing as he ought, he
should be now one of the finest anglers in England.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>So.&nbsp; Thanks to bank fishing, we have, you see, landed
three or four more good fish in the last two
hours&mdash;And!&nbsp; What is here?&nbsp; An ugly two-pound
chub, Chevin, &lsquo;Echevin,&rsquo; or Alderman, as the French
call him.&nbsp; How is this, keeper?&nbsp; I thought you allowed
no such vermin in this water?</p>
<p>The keeper answers, with a grunt, that &lsquo;they allow
themselves.&nbsp; That there always were chub hereabouts, and
always will be; for the more he takes out with the net, the more
come next day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Probably.&nbsp; No nets will exterminate these spawn-eating,
fry-eating, all-eating pests, who devour the little trout, and
starve the large ones, and, at the first sign of the net, fly to
hover among the most tangled roots.&nbsp; There they lie, as
close as rats in a bank, and work themselves the farther in the
more they are splashed and poked by the poles of the
beaters.&nbsp; But the fly, well used, will&mdash;if not
exterminate them&mdash;still thin them down greatly; and very
good sport they give, in my opinion, in spite of the contempt in
which they are commonly held, as chicken-hearted fish, who show
no fight.&nbsp; True; but their very cowardice makes them the
more difficult to catch; for no fish must you keep more out of
sight, and further off.&nbsp; The very shadow of the line (not to
mention that of the rod) sends them flying to hover; and they
rise so cautiously and quietly, that they give excellent lessons
in patience and nerve to a beginner.&nbsp; If the fly is dragged
along the surface, or jerked suddenly from them, they flee from
it in terror; and when they do, after due deliberation, take it
in, their rise is so quiet, that you can seldom tell whether your
fish weighs half a pound or four pounds and a half&mdash;unless
you, like most beginners, attempt to show your quickness by that
most useless exertion, a violent strike.&nbsp; Then, the snapping
of your footlink, or&mdash;just as likely&mdash;of the top of
your rod, makes you fully aware, if not of the pluck, at least of
the brute strength, of the burly alderman of the waters.&nbsp; No
fish, therefore, will better teach the beginner the good old
lesson, &lsquo;not to frighten a fish before you have tired
him.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For flies&mdash;chub will rise greedily at any large palmers,
the larger and rougher the better.&nbsp; A red and a grizzled
hackle will always take them; but the best fly of all is an
imitation of the black beetle&mdash;the &lsquo;undertaker&rsquo;
of the London shops.&nbsp; He, too, can hardly be too large, and
should be made of a fat body of black wool, with the metallic
black feather of a cock&rsquo;s tail wrapped loosely over
it.&nbsp; A still better wing is one of the neck feathers of any
metallic-plumed bird, e.g., <i>Phlogophorus Impeyanus</i>, the
Menaul Pheasant, laid flat and whole on the back, to imitate the
wing-shells of the beetle, the legs being represented by any
loose black feathers&mdash;(not hackles, which are too
fine.)&nbsp; Tied thus, it will kill not only every chub in a
pool (if you give the survivors a quarter of an hour wherein to
recover from their horror at their last friend&rsquo;s fate), but
also, here and there, very large trout.</p>
<p>Another slur upon the noble sport of chub fishing is the fact
of his not being worth eating&mdash;a fact which, in the true
sportsman&rsquo;s eyes, will go for nothing.&nbsp; But though the
man who can buy fresh soles and salmon may despise chub, there
are those who do not.&nbsp; True, you may make a most accurate
imitation of him by taking one of Palmer&rsquo;s patent candles,
wick and all, stuffing it with needles and split bristles, and
then stewing the same in ditch-water.&nbsp; Nevertheless, strange
to say, the agricultural stomach digests chub; and if, after
having filled your creel, or three creels (as you may too often),
with them, you will distribute them on your way home to all the
old women you meet, you will make many poor souls happy, after
having saved the lives of many trout.</p>
<p>But here we come to a strip of thick cover, part of our
Squire&rsquo;s home preserves, which it is impossible to fish, so
closely do the boughs cover the water.&nbsp; We will walk on
through it towards the hall, and there get&mdash;what we begin
sorely to need&mdash;something to eat.&nbsp; It will be of little
use fishing for some time to come; for these hot hours of the
afternoon, from three till six, are generally the &lsquo;deadest
time&rsquo; of the whole day.</p>
<p>And now, when we have struggled in imagination through the
last bit of copse, and tumbled over the palings into the lawn, we
shall see a scene quite as lovely, if you will believe it, as any
alp on earth.</p>
<p>What shall we see, as we look across the broad, still, clear
river, where the great dark trout sail to and fro lazily in the
sun?&nbsp; For having free-warren of our fancy and our paper, we
may see what we choose.</p>
<p>White chalk-fields above, quivering hazy in the heat.&nbsp; A
park full of merry haymakers; gay red and blue waggons; stalwart
horses switching off the flies; dark avenues of tall elms; groups
of abele, &lsquo;tossing their whispering silver to the
sun;&rsquo; and amid them the house.&nbsp; What manner of house
shall it be?&nbsp; Tudor or Elizabethan, with oriels, mullioned
windows, gables, and turrets of strange shape?&nbsp; No: that is
commonplace.&nbsp; Everybody builds Tudor houses now.&nbsp; Our
house shall smack of Inigo Jones or Christopher Wren; a great
square red-brick mass, made light and cheerful though, by quoins
and windows of white Sarsden stone; with high-peaked French
roofs, broken by louvres and dormers, haunted by a thousand
swallows and starlings.&nbsp; Old walled gardens, gay with
flowers, shall stretch right and left.&nbsp; Clipt yew alleys
shall wander away into mysterious glooms: and out of their black
arches shall come tripping children, like white fairies, to laugh
and talk with the girl who lies dreaming and reading in the
hammock there, beneath the black velvet canopy of the great
cedar-tree, like some fair Tropic flower hanging from its
boughs.&nbsp; Then they shall wander down across the smooth-shorn
lawn, where the purple rhododendrons hang double, bush and image,
over the water&rsquo;s edge, and call to us across the stream,
&lsquo;What sport?&rsquo; and the old Squire shall beckon the
keeper over the long stone bridge, and return with him bringing
luncheon and good ale; and we will sit down, and eat and drink
among the burdock leaves, and then watch the quiet house, and
lawn, and flowers, and fair human creatures, and shining water,
all sleeping breathless in the glorious light beneath the
glorious blue, till we doze off, lulled by the murmur of a
thousand insects, and the rich minstrelsy of nightingale and
black-cap, thrush and dove.</p>
<p>Peaceful, graceful, complete English country life and country
houses; everywhere finish and polish; Nature perfected by the
wealth and art of peaceful centuries!&nbsp; Why should I exchange
you, even for the sight of all the Alps, for bad roads, bad
carriages, bad inns, bad food, bad washing, bad beds, and fleas,
fleas, fleas?</p>
<p>Let that last thought be enough.&nbsp; There may be follies,
there may be sorrows, there may be sins&mdash;though I know there
are no very heavy ones&mdash;in that fine old house opposite: but
thanks to the genius of my native land, there are at least no
fleas.</p>
<p>Think of that, wandering friend; and of this also, that you
will find your warm bath ready when you go to bed to-night, and
your cold one when you rise to-morrow morning; and in content and
thankfulness, stay in England, and be clean.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>Here, then, let us lounge a full two hours, too comfortable
and too tired to care for fishing, till the hall-bell rings for
that dinner which we as good anglers will despise.&nbsp; Then we
will make our way to the broad reaches above the house.&nbsp; The
evening breeze should be ruffling them gallantly; and see, the
fly is getting up.&nbsp; Countless thousands are rising off the
grass, and flickering to and fro above the stream.&nbsp; Stand
still a moment, and you will hear the air full of the soft rustle
of innumerable wings.&nbsp; Hundreds more, even more delicate and
gauzy, are rising through the water, and floating helplessly
along the surface, as Aphrodite may have done when she rose in
the &AElig;gean, half frightened at the sight of the new upper
world.&nbsp; And, see, the great trout are moving
everywhere.&nbsp; Fish too large and well fed to care for the fly
at any other season, who have been lounging among the weeds all
day and snapping at passing minnows, have come to the surface;
and are feeding steadily, splashing five or six times in
succession, and then going down awhile to bolt their mouthful of
victims; while here and there a heavy silent swirl tells of a fly
taken before it has reached the surface, untimely slain before it
has seen the day.</p>
<p>Now&mdash;put your Green-drake on; and throw, regardless of
bank-fishing or any other rule, wherever you see a fish
rise.&nbsp; Do not work your flies in the least, but let them
float down over the fish, or sink if they will; he is more likely
to take them under water than on the top.&nbsp; And mind this
rule: be patient with your fish; and do not fancy that because he
does not rise to you the first or the tenth time, therefore he
will not rise at all.&nbsp; He may have filled his mouth and gone
down to gorge; and when he comes up again, if your fly be the
first which he meets, he will probably seize it greedily, and all
the more so if it be under water, so seeming drowned and
helpless.&nbsp; Besides, a fish seldom rises twice exactly in the
same place, unless he be lying between two weeds, or in the
corner of an eddy.&nbsp; His small wits, when he is feeding in
the open, seem to hint to him that after having found a fly in
one place he must move a foot or two on to find another; and
therefore it may be some time before your turn comes, and your
fly passes just over his nose; which if it do not do, he
certainly will not, amid such an abundance, go out of his way for
it.&nbsp; In the meanwhile your footlink will very probably have
hit him over the back, or run foul of his nose, in which case you
will not catch him at all.&nbsp; A painful fact for you; but if
you could catch every fish you saw, where would be the trout for
next season?</p>
<p>Put on a dropper of some kind, say a caperer, as a second
chance.&nbsp; I almost prefer the dark claret-spinner, with which
I have killed very large fish alternately with the green-drake,
even when it was quite dark; and for your stretcher, of course a
green-drake.</p>
<p>For a blustering evening like this your drake can hardly be
too large or too rough; in brighter and stiller weather the fish
often prefer a fly half the size of the natural one.&nbsp; Only
bear in mind that the most tempting form among these millions of
drakes is that one whose wings are very little coloured at all,
of a pale greenish yellow; whose body is straw-coloured, and his
head, thorax, and legs, spotted with dark brown&mdash;best
represented by a pheasant or coch-a-bonddhu hackle.</p>
<p>The best imitation of this, or of any drake, which I have ever
seen, is one by Mr. Macgowan, whilome of Ballyshannon, now of No.
7, Bruton-street, Berkeley-square, whose drakes, known by a waxy
body of some mysterious material, do surpass those of all other
men, and should be known and honoured far and wide.&nbsp; But
failing them, you may do well with a drake which is ribbed
through the whole length with red hackle over a straw-coloured
body.&nbsp; A North-countryman would laugh at it, and ask us how
we fancy that fish will mistake for that delicate waxy fly a
heavy rough palmer, made heavier and rougher by two thick tufts
of yellow mallard wing: but if he will fish therewith, he will
catch trout; and mighty ones they will be.&nbsp; I have found,
again and again, this drake, in which the hackle is ribbed all
down the body, beat a bare-bodied one in the ratio of three fish
to one.&nbsp; The reason is difficult to guess.&nbsp; Perhaps the
shining transparent hackle gives the fly more of the waxy look of
the natural insect; or perhaps the &lsquo;buzzly&rsquo; look of
the fly causes the fish to mistake it for one half emerged from
its pupa case, fluttering, entangled, and helpless.&nbsp; But
whatever be the cause, I am sure of the fact.&nbsp;
Now&mdash;silence and sport for the next three hours.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>There!&nbsp; All things must end.&nbsp; It is so dark that I
have been fishing for the last five minutes without any end fly;
and we have lost our two last fish simply by not being able to
guide them into the net.&nbsp; But what an evening&rsquo;s sport
we have had!&nbsp; Beside several over a pound which I have
thrown in (I trust you have been generous and done likewise),
there are six fish averaging two pounds apiece; and what is the
weight of that monster with whom I saw you wrestling dimly
through the dusk, your legs stuck knee-deep in a mudbank, your
head embowered in nettles, while the keeper waltzed round you,
roaring mere incoherencies?&mdash;four pounds full.&nbsp; Now, is
there any sherry left in the flask?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Then we will
give the keeper five shillings; he is well worth his pay; and
then drag our weary limbs towards the hall to bath, supper, and
bed; while you confess, I trust, that you may get noble sport,
hard exercise, and lovely scenery, without going sixty miles from
London town.</p>
<h2><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>III.<br />
<a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span><i>THE
FENS</i>.</h2>
<p>A <span class="smcap">certain</span> sadness is pardonable to
one who watches the destruction of a grand natural phenomenon,
even though its destruction bring blessings to the human
race.&nbsp; Reason and conscience tell us, that it is right and
good that the Great Fen should have become, instead of a waste
and howling wilderness, a garden of the Lord, where</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;All the land in flowery squares,<br />
Beneath a broad and equal-blowing wind,<br />
Smells of the coming summer.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And yet the fancy may linger, without blame, over the shining
meres, the golden reed-beds, the countless water-fowl, the
strange and gaudy insects, the wild nature, the mystery, the
majesty&mdash;for mystery and majesty there were&mdash;which
haunted the deep fens for many a hundred years.&nbsp; Little
thinks the Scotsman, whirled down by the Great Northern Railway
from Peterborough to Huntingdon, what a grand place, even twenty
years ago, was that Holme and Whittlesea, which is now but a
black, unsightly, steaming flat, from which the meres and
reed-beds of the old world are gone, while the corn and roots of
the new world have not as yet taken their place.</p>
<p>But grand enough it was, that black ugly place, when backed by
Caistor Hanglands and Holme Wood, and the patches of the
prim&aelig;val forest; while dark-green alders, and pale-green
reeds, stretched for miles round the broad lagoon, where the coot
clanked, and the bittern boomed, and the sedge-bird, not content
with its own sweet song, mocked the notes of all the birds
around; while high overhead hung, motionless, hawk beyond hawk,
buzzard beyond buzzard, kite beyond kite, as far as eye could
see.&nbsp; Far off, upon the silver mere, would rise a puff of
smoke from a punt, invisible from its flatness and its white
paint.&nbsp; Then down the wind came the boom of the great
stanchion-gun; and after that sound another sound, louder as it
neared; a cry as of all the bells of Cambridge, and all the
hounds of Cottesmore; and overhead rushed and whirled the skein
of terrified wild-fowl, screaming, piping, clacking, croaking,
filling the air with the hoarse rattle of their wings, while
clear above all sounded the wild whistle of the curlew, and the
trumpet note of the great wild swan.</p>
<p>They are all gone now.&nbsp; No longer do the ruffs trample
the sedge into a hard floor in their fighting-rings, while the
sober reeves stand round, admiring the tournament of their
lovers, gay with ears and tippets, no two of them alike.&nbsp;
Gone are ruffs and reeves, spoonbills, bitterns, avosets; the
very snipe, one hears, disdains to breed.&nbsp; Gone, too, not
only from Whittlesea but from the whole world, is that most
exquisite of English butterflies, <i>Lyc&aelig;na
dispar</i>&mdash;the great copper; and many a curious insect
more.&nbsp; Ah, well, at least we shall have wheat and mutton
instead, and no more typhus and ague; and, it is to be hoped, no
more brandy-drinking and opium-eating; and children will live and
not die.&nbsp; For it was a hard place to live in, the old Fen; a
place wherein one heard of &lsquo;unexampled instances of
longevity,&rsquo; for the same reason that one hears of them in
savage tribes&mdash;that few lived to old age at all, save those
iron constitutions which nothing could break down.</p>
<p>And now, when the bold Fen-men, who had been fighting water by
the help of wind, have given up the more capricious element for
that more manageable servant fire; have replaced their wind-mills
by steam-engines, which will work in all weathers; and have
pumped the whole fen dry&mdash;even too dry, as the last hot
summer proved; when the only bit of the prim&aelig;val wilderness
left, as far as I know, is 200 acres of sweet sedge and
<i>Lastr&aelig;a thelypteris</i> in Wicken Fen: there can be no
harm in lingering awhile over the past, and telling of what the
Great Fen was, and how it came to be that great flat which
reaches (roughly speaking) from Cambridge to Peterborough on the
south-west side, to Lynn and Tattershall on the north-east, some
forty miles and more each way.</p>
<p>To do that rightly, and describe how the Fen came to be, one
must go back, it seems to me, to an age before all history; an
age which cannot be measured by years or centuries; an age
shrouded in mystery, and to be spoken of only in guesses.&nbsp;
To assert anything positively concerning that age, or ages, would
be to show the rashness of ignorance.&nbsp; &lsquo;I think that I
believe,&rsquo; &lsquo;I have good reason to suspect,&rsquo;
&lsquo;I seem to see,&rsquo; are the strongest forms of speech
which ought to be used over a matter so vast and as yet so little
elaborated.</p>
<p>&lsquo;I seem to see,&rsquo; then, an epoch after those strata
were laid down with which geology generally deals; after the
Kimmeridge clay, Oxford clay, and Gault clay, which form the
impervious bedding of the fens, with their intermediate beds of
coral-rag and green sand, had been deposited; after the chalk had
been laid on the top of them, at the bottom of some ancient
ocean; after (and what a gulf of time is implied in that last
&lsquo;after!&rsquo;) the boulder-clay (coeval probably with the
&lsquo;till&rsquo; of Scotland) had been spread out in the
&lsquo;age of ice&rsquo; on top of all; after the whole had been
upheaved out of the sea, and stood about the same level as it
stands now: but before the great valley of the Cam had been
scooped out, and the strata were still continuous, some 200 feet
above Cambridge and its colleges, from the top of the Gog-magogs
to the top of Madingley Rise.</p>
<p>In those ages&mdash;while the valleys of the Cam, the Ouse,
the Nene, the Welland, the Glen, and the Witham were sawing
themselves out by no violent convulsions, but simply, as I
believe, by the same slow action of rain and rivers by which they
are sawing backward into the land even now&mdash;I &lsquo;seem to
see&rsquo; a time when the Straits of Dover did not exist&mdash;a
time when a great part of the German Ocean was dry land.&nbsp;
Through it, into a great estuary between North Britain and
Norway, flowed together all the rivers of north-eastern
Europe&mdash;Elbe, Weser, Rhine, Scheldt, Seine, Thames, and all
the rivers of east England, as far north as the Humber.</p>
<p>And if a reason be required for so daring a theory&mdash;first
started, if I recollect right, by the late lamented Edward
Forbes&mdash;a sufficient one may be found in one look over a
bridge, in any river of the East of England.&nbsp; There we see
various species of Cyprinid&aelig;, &lsquo;rough&rsquo; or
&lsquo;white&rsquo; fish&mdash;roach, dace, chub, bream, and so
forth, and with them their natural attendant and devourer, the
pike.</p>
<p>Now these fish belong almost exclusively to the same system of
rivers&mdash;those of north-east Europe.&nbsp; They attain their
highest development in the great lakes of Sweden.&nbsp; Westward
of the Straits of Dover they are not indigenous.&nbsp; They may
be found in the streams of south and western England; but in
every case, I believe, they have been introduced either by birds
or by men.&nbsp; From some now submerged &lsquo;centre of
creation&rsquo; (to use poor Edward Forbes&rsquo;s formula) they
must have spread into the rivers where they are now found; and
spread by fresh water, and not by salt, which would destroy them
in a single tide.</p>
<p>Again, there lingers in the Cam, and a few other rivers of
north-eastern Europe, that curious fish the eel-pout or
&lsquo;burbot&rsquo; (<i>Molva lota</i>).&nbsp; Now he is utterly
distinct from any other fresh-water fish of Europe.&nbsp; His
nearest ally is the ling (<i>Molva vulgaris</i>); a deep-sea
fish, even as his ancestors have been.&nbsp; Originally a
deep-sea form, he has found his way up the rivers, even to
Cambridge, and there remains.&nbsp; The rivers by which he came
up, the land through which he passed, ages and ages since, have
been all swept away; and he has never found his way back to his
native salt-water, but lives on in a strange land, degraded in
form, dwindling in numbers, and now fast dying out.&nbsp; The
explanation may be strange: but it is the only one which I can
offer to explain the fact&mdash;which is itself much more
strange&mdash;of the burbot being found in the Fen rivers.</p>
<p>Another proof may be found in the presence of the edible frog
of the Continent at Foulmire, on the edge of the Cambridge
Fans.&nbsp; It is a moot point still with some, whether he was
not put there by man.&nbsp; It is a still stronger argument
against his being indigenous, that he is never mentioned as an
article of food by the medi&aelig;val monks, who would have
known&mdash;Frenchmen, Italians, Germans, as many of them
were&mdash;that he is as dainty as ever was a spring
chicken.&nbsp; But if he be indigenous, his presence proves that
once he could either hop across the Straits of Dover, or swim
across the German Ocean.</p>
<p>But there can be no doubt of the next proof&mdash;the presence
in the Fens (where he is now probably extinct) and in certain
spots in East Anglia, which I shall take care not to mention, of
that exquisite little bird the &lsquo;Bearded Tit&rsquo;
(<i>Calamophilus biarmicus</i>).&nbsp; Tit he is none; rather, it
is said, a finch, but connected with no other English bird.&nbsp;
His central home is in the marshes of Russia and Prussia; his
food the mollusks which swarm among the reed-beds where he
builds; and feeding on those from reed-bed to reed bed, all
across what was once the German Ocean, has come the beautiful
little bird with long tail, orange tawny plumage, and black
moustache, which might have been seen forty years ago in hundreds
on ever reed-rond of the Fen.</p>
<p>One more proof&mdash;for it is the heaping up of facts, each
minute by itself, which issues often in a sound and great
result.&nbsp; In draining Wretham Mere, in Norfolk, not so very
far from the Fens, in the year 1856 there were found embedded in
the peat moss (which is not the Scotch and Western <i>Sphagnum
palustre</i>, but an altogether different moss, <i>Hypnum
fluitans</i>), remains of an ancient lake-dwelling, supported on
piles.&nbsp; A dwelling like those which have lately attracted so
much notice in the lakes of Switzerland: like those which the
Dyaks make about the ports and rivers of Borneo; dwellings
invented, it seems to me, to enable the inhabitants to escape not
wild beasts only, but malaria and night frosts; and, perched
above the cold and poisonous fogs, to sleep, if not high and dry,
at least high and healthy.</p>
<p>In the bottom of this mere were found two shells of the
fresh-water tortoise, <i>Emys lutaria</i>, till then unknown in
England.</p>
<p>These little animals, who may be seen in hundreds in the meres
of eastern Europe, sunning their backs on fallen logs, and diving
into the water at the sound of a footstep, are eaten largely in
continental capitals (as is their cousin the terrapin, <i>Emys
picta</i>, in the Southern States).&nbsp; They may be bought at
Paris, at fashionable restaurants.&nbsp; Thither they may have
been sent from Vienna or Berlin; for in north France, Holland,
and north-west Germany they are unknown.&nbsp; A few specimens
have been found buried in peat in Sweden and Denmark; and there
is a tale of a live one having been found in the extreme south
part of Sweden, some twenty years ago. <a
name="citation103"></a><a href="#footnote103"
class="citation">[103]</a>&nbsp; Into Sweden, then, as into
England, the little fresh-water tortoise had wandered, as to an
extreme limit, beyond which the change of climate, and probably
of food, killed him off.</p>
<p>But the emys which came to the Wretham bog must have had a
long journey; and a journey by fresh water too.&nbsp; Down Elbe
or Weser he must have floated, ice-packed, or swept away by
flood, till somewhere off the Doggerbank, in that great network
of rivers which is now open sea, he or his descendants turned up
Ouse and Little Ouse, till they found a mere like their old
Prussian one, and there founded a tiny colony for a few
generations, till they were eaten up by the savages of the table
dwelling; or died out&mdash;as many a human family has died
out&mdash;because they found the world too hard.</p>
<p>And lastly, my friend Mr. Brady, well known to naturalists,
has found that many forms of Entomastraca are common to the
estuaries of the east of England and to those of Holland.</p>
<p>It was thus necessary, in order to account for the presence of
some of the common animals of the fen, to go back to an epoch of
immense remoteness.</p>
<p>And how was that great lowland swept away?&nbsp; Who can
tell?&nbsp; Probably by no violent convulsion.&nbsp; Slow
upheavals, slow depressions, there may have been&mdash;indeed
must have been&mdash;as the sunken fir-forests of Brancaster, and
the raised beach of Hunstanton, on the extreme north-east corner
of the Wash, testify to this day.&nbsp; But the main agent of
destruction has been, doubtless, that same ever-gnawing sea-wash
which devours still the soft strata of the whole east coast of
England, as far as Flamborough Head; and that great scavenger,
the tide-wave, which sweeps the fallen rubbish out to sea twice
in every twenty-four hours.&nbsp; Wave and tide by sea, rain and
river by land; these are God&rsquo;s mighty mills in which He
makes the old world new.&nbsp; And as Longfellow says of moral
things, so may we of physical:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet
they grind exceeding small.<br />
Though He sit, end wait with patience, with exactness grinds He
all.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The lighter and more soluble particles, during that slow but
vast destruction which is going on still to this day, have been
carried far out to sea, and deposited as ooze.&nbsp; The heavier
and coarser have been left along the shores, as the gravels which
fill the old estuaries of the east of England.</p>
<p>From these gravels we can judge of the larger animals which
dwelt in that old world.&nbsp; About these lost lowlands wandered
herds of the woolly mammoth.&nbsp; <i>Elephas primigenius</i>,
whose bones are common in certain Cambridge gravels, whose teeth
are brought up by dredgers, far out in the German Ocean, off
certain parts of the Norfolk coast.&nbsp; With them wandered the
woolly rhinoceros (<i>R. tichorhinus</i>), the hippopotamus, the
lion&mdash;not (according to some) to be distinguished from the
recent lion of Africa&mdash;the hy&aelig;na, the bear, the horse,
the reindeer, and the musk ox; the great Irish elk, whose vast
horns are so well known in every museum of northern Europe; and
that mighty ox, the <i>Bos primigenius</i>, which still lingered
on the Continent in C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s time, as the urus, in
magnitude less only than the elephant,&mdash;and not to be
confounded with the bison, a relation of, if not identical with,
the buffalo of North America,&mdash;which still lingers,
carefully preserved by the Czar, in the forests of Lithuania.</p>
<p>The remains of this gigantic ox, be it remembered, are found
throughout Britain, and even into the Shetland Isles.&nbsp; Would
that any gentleman who may see these pages would take notice of
the fact, that we have not (so I am informed) in these islands a
single perfect skeleton of <i>Bos primigenius</i>; while the
Museum of Copenhagen, to its honour, possesses five or six from a
much smaller field than is open to us; and be public-spirited
enough, the next time he hears of ox-bones, whether in gravel or
in peat (as he may in the draining of any northern moss), to
preserve them for the museum of his neighbourhood&mdash;or send
them to Cambridge.</p>
<p>But did all these animals exist at the same time?&nbsp; It is
difficult to say.&nbsp; The study of the different gravels is
most intricate&mdash;almost a special science in itself&mdash;in
which but two or three men are adepts.&nbsp; It is hard, at first
sight, to believe that the hippopotamus could have been the
neighbour of the Arctic reindeer and musk ox: but that the woolly
mammoth not only may have been such, but was such, there can be
no doubt.&nbsp; His remains, imbedded in ice at the mouth of the
great Siberian rivers, with the wool, skin, and flesh (in some
cases) still remaining on the bones, prove him to have been
fitted for a cold climate, and to have browsed upon the scanty
shrubs of Northern Asia.&nbsp; But, indeed, there is no reason,
<i>&agrave; priori</i>, why these huge mammals, now confined to
hotter countries, should not have once inhabited a colder region,
or at least have wandered northwards in whole herds in summer, to
escape insects, and find fresh food, and above all, water.&nbsp;
The same is the case with the lion, and other huge beasts of
prey.&nbsp; The tiger of Hindostan ranges, at least in summer,
across the snows of the Himalaya, and throughout China.&nbsp;
Even at the river Amoor, where the winters are as severe as at
St. Petersburg, the tiger is an ordinary resident at all
seasons.&nbsp; The lion was, undoubtedly, an inhabitant of Thrace
as late as the expedition of Xerxes, whose camels they attacked;
and the &lsquo;Nem&aelig;an lion,&rsquo; and the other lions
which stand out in Grecian myth, as having been killed by
Hercules and the heroes, may have been the last remaining
specimens of that <i>Felis spel&aelig;a</i> (undistinguishable,
according to some, from the African lion), whose bones are found
in the gravels and the caverns of these isles.</p>
<p>And how long ago were those days of mammoths and reindeer,
lions and hy&aelig;nas?&nbsp; We must talk not of days, but of
ages; we know nothing of days or years.&nbsp; As the late
lamented Professor Sedgwick has well said:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We allow that the great European oscillation, which
ended in the production of the drift (the boulder clay, or till),
was effected during a time of vast, but unknown length.&nbsp; And
if we limit our inquiries, and ask what was the interval of time
between the newest bed of gravel near Cambridge, and the oldest
bed of bogland or silt in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk, we are
utterly at a loss for a definite answer.&nbsp; The interval of
time may have been very great.&nbsp; But we have no scale on
which to measure it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Let us suppose, then, the era of &lsquo;gravels&rsquo; past;
the valleys which open into the fen sawn out by rivers to about
their present depth.&nbsp; What was the special cause of the fen
itself? why did not the great lowland become a fertile
&lsquo;carse&rsquo; of firm alluvial soil, like that of
Stirling?</p>
<p>One reason is, that the carse of Stirling has been upheaved
some twenty feet, and thereby more or less drained, since the
time of the Romans.&nbsp; A fact patent and provable from Cramond
(the old Roman port of Alaterna) up to Blair Drummond above
Stirling, where whales&rsquo; skeletons, and bone tools by them,
have been found in loam and peat, twenty feet above high-water
mark.&nbsp; The alluvium of the fens, on the other hand, has very
probably suffered a slight depression.</p>
<p>But the main reason is, that the silt brought down by the fen
rivers cannot, like that of the Forth and its neighbouring
streams, get safe away to sea.&nbsp; From Flamborough Head, in
Yorkshire, all down the Lincolnshire coast, the land is falling,
falling for ever into the waves; and swept southward by tide and
current, the debris turns into the Wash between Lincolnshire and
Norfolk, there to repose, as in a quiet haven.</p>
<p>Hence that vast labyrinth of banks between Lynn and Wisbeach,
of mud inside, brought down by the fen rivers; but outside
(contrary to the usual rule) of shifting sand, which has come
inward from the sea, and prevents the mud&rsquo;s
escape&mdash;banks parted by narrow gullies, the delight of the
gunner with his punt, haunted by million wild-fowl in winter, and
in summer hazy steaming flats, beyond which the trees of
Lincolnshire loom up, raised by refraction far above the horizon,
while the masts and sails of distant vessels quiver,
fantastically distorted and lengthened, sometimes even inverted,
by a refraction like that which plays such tricks with ships and
coasts in the Arctic seas.&nbsp; Along the top of the mud banks
lounge the long black rows of seals, undistinguishable from their
reflection in the still water below; distorted too, and magnified
to the size of elephants.&nbsp; Long lines of sea-pies wing their
way along at regular tide-hours, from or to the ocean.&nbsp; Now
and then a skein of geese paddle hastily out of sight round a
mud-cape; or a brown robber gull (generally Richardson&rsquo;s
<i>Skua</i>) raises a tumult of screams, by making a raid upon a
party of honest white gulls, to frighten them into vomiting up
their prey for his benefit; or a single cormorant flaps along,
close to the water, towards his fishing ground.&nbsp; Even the
fish are shy of haunting a bottom which shifts with every storm;
and innumerable shrimps are almost the only product of the
shallow barren sea: beside, all is silence and desolation, as of
a world waiting to be made.</p>
<p>So strong is the barrier which these sea-borne sands oppose to
the river-borne ooze, that as soon as a seabank is built&mdash;as
the projectors of the &lsquo;Victoria County&rsquo; have built
them&mdash;across any part of the estuary, the mud caught by it
soon &lsquo;warps&rsquo; the space within into firm and rich dry
land.&nbsp; But that same barrier, ere the fen was drained,
backed up for ages not only the silt, but the very water of the
fens; and spread it inland into a labyrinth of shifting streams,
shallow meres, and vast peat bogs, on those impervious clays
which floor the fen.&nbsp; Each river contributed to the
formation of those bogs and meres, instead of draining them away;
repeating on a huge scale the process which may be seen in many a
highland strath, where the ground at the edge of the stream is
firm and high; the meadows near the hillfoot, a few hundred yards
away, bogland lower than the bank of the stream.&nbsp; For each
flood deposits its silt upon the immediate bank of the river,
raising it year by year; till&mdash;as in the case of the
&lsquo;Lev&eacute;e&rsquo; of the Mississippi, and probably of
every one of the old fen rivers&mdash;the stream runs at last
between two natural dykes, at a level considerably higher than
that of the now swamped and undrainable lands right and left of
it.</p>
<p>If we add to this, a slope in the fen rivers so
extraordinarily slight, that the river at Cambridge is only
thirteen and a half feet above the mean sea level,
five-and-thirty miles away, and that if the great sea-sluice of
Denver, the key of all the eastern fen, were washed away, the
tide would back up the Cam to within ten miles of Cambridge; if
we add again the rainfall upon that vast flat area, utterly
unable to escape through rivers which have enough to do to drain
the hills around; it is easy to understand how peat, the certain
product of standing water, has slowly overwhelmed the rich
alluvium, fattened by the washing of those phosphatic greensand
beds, which (discovered by the science of the lamented Professor
Henslow) are now yielding round Cambridge supplies of manure
seemingly inexhaustible.&nbsp; Easy it is to understand how the
all-devouring, yet all-preserving peat-moss swallowed up
gradually the stately forests of fir and oak, ash and poplar,
hazel and yew, which once grew on that rank land; how trees, torn
down by flood or storm, floated and lodged in rafts, damming the
waters back still more; how streams, bewildered in the flats,
changed their channels, mingling silt and sand with the
peat-moss; how Nature, left to herself, ran into wild riot and
chaos more and more; till the whole fen became one &lsquo;Dismal
Swamp,&rsquo; in which the &lsquo;Last of the English&rsquo;
(like Dred in Mrs. Stowe&rsquo;s tale) took refuge from their
tyrants, and lived, like him, a free and joyous life awhile.</p>
<p>For there were islands, and are still, in that wide fen, which
have escaped the destroying deluge of peat-moss; outcrops of firm
land, which even in the Middle Age preserved the Fauna and Flora
of the prim&aelig;val forest, haunted by the descendants of some
at least of those wild beasts which roamed on the older continent
of the &lsquo;gravel age.&rsquo;&nbsp; The all-preserving peat,
as well as the monkish records of the early Middle Age, enable us
to repeople, tolerably well, the prim&aelig;val fen.</p>
<p>The gigantic ox, <i>Bos primigenius</i>, was still there,
though there is no record of him in monkish tales.&nbsp; But with
him had appeared (not unknown toward the end of the gravel age)
another ox, smaller and with shorter horns, <i>Bos
longifrons</i>; which is held to be the ancestor of our own
domestic short-horns, and of the wild cattle still preserved at
Chillingham and at Cadzow.&nbsp; The reindeer had disappeared,
almost or altogether.&nbsp; The red deer, of a size beside which
the largest Scotch stag is puny, and even the great Carpathian
stag inferior, abound; so does the roe, so does the goat, which
one is accustomed to look on as a mountain animal.&nbsp; In the
Woodwardian Museum there is a portion of a skull of an
ibex&mdash;probably <i>Capra sibirica</i>&mdash;which was found
in the drift gravel at Fulbourne.&nbsp; Wild sheep are
unknown.&nbsp; The horse occurs in the peat; but whether wild or
tame, who can tell?&nbsp; Horses enough have been mired and
drowned since the Romans set foot on this island, to account for
the presence of horses&rsquo; skulls, without the hypothesis of
wild herds, such as doubtless existed in the gravel times.&nbsp;
The wolf, of course, is common; wild cat, marten, badger, and
otter all would expect; but not so the beaver, which nevertheless
is abundant in the peat; and damage enough the busy fellows must
have done, cutting trees, damming streams, flooding marshes, and
like selfish speculators in all ages, sacrificing freely the
public interest to their own.&nbsp; Here and there are found the
skulls of bears, in one case that of a polar bear, ice-drifted;
and one of a walrus, probably washed in dead after a storm.</p>
<p>Beautiful, after their kind, were these fen-isles, in the eyes
of the monks who were the first settlers in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The author of the History of Ramsey grows enthusiastic, and,
after the manner of old monks, somewhat bombastic also, as he
describes the lonely isle which got its name from the solitary
ram who had wandered thither, either in some extreme drought or
over the winter ice, and never able to return, was found, fat
beyond the wont of rams, feeding among the wild deer.&nbsp; He
tells of the stately ashes&mdash;most of them cut in his time, to
furnish mighty beams for the church roof; of the rich pastures
painted with all gay flowers in spring; of the &lsquo;green
crown&rsquo; of reed and alder which girdled round the isle; of
the fair wide mere with its &lsquo;sandy beach&rsquo; along the
forest side: &lsquo;a delight,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;to all who
look thereon.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In like humour, William of Malmesbury, writing in the first
half of the twelfth century, speaks of Thorney Abbey and
isle.&nbsp; &lsquo;It represents,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;a very
Paradise, for that in pleasure and delight it resembles heaven
itself.&nbsp; These marshes abound in trees, whose length without
a knot doth emulate the stars.&nbsp; The plain there is as level
as the sea, which with green grass allures the eye, and so smooth
that there is nought to hinder him who runs through it.&nbsp;
Neither is therein any waste place for in some parts are apple
trees, in other vines, which are either spread on the ground or
raised on poles.&nbsp; A mutual strife is there between nature
and art; so that what one produces not, the other supplies.&nbsp;
What shall I say of those fair buildings, which &rsquo;tis so
wonderful to see the ground among those fens upbear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the most detailed picture of a fen-isle is that in the
second part of the Book of Ely; wherein a single knight of all
the French army forces his way into the isle of St. Etheldreda,
and, hospitably entertained there by Hereward and his English, is
sent back safe to William the Conqueror, to tell him of the
strength of Ely isle.</p>
<p>He cannot praise enough&mdash;his speech may be mythical; but
as written by Richard of Ely, only one generation after, it must
describe faithfully what the place was like&mdash;the wonders of
the isle: its soil the richest in England, its pleasant pastures,
its noble hunting-grounds, its store of sheep and cattle (though
its vines, he says, as a Frenchman had good right to say, were
not equally to be praised), its wide meres and bogs, about it
like a wall.&nbsp; In it was, to quote roughly, &lsquo;abundance
of tame beasts and of wild stag, roe, and goat, in grove and
marsh; martens, and ermines, and fitchets, which in hard winter
were caught in snares or gins.&nbsp; But of the kind of fish and
fowl which bred therein, what can I say?&nbsp; In the pools
around are netted eels innumerable, great water wolves, and
pickerel, perch, roach, burbot, lampreys, which the French called
sea-serpents; smelts, too; and the royal fish, the turbot [surely
a mistake for sturgeon], are said often to be taken.&nbsp; But of
the birds which haunt around, if you be not tired, as of the
rest, we will expound.&nbsp; Innumerable geese, gulls, coots,
divers, water-crows, herons, ducks, of which, when there is most
plenty, in winter, or at moulting time, I have seen hundreds
taken at a time, by nets, springes, or birdlime,&rsquo; and so
forth till, as he assures William, the Frenchman may sit on
Haddenham field blockading Ely for seven years more, &lsquo;ere
they will make one ploughman stop short in his furrow, one hunter
cease to set his nets, or one fowler to deceive the birds with
springe and snare.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And yet there was another side to the picture.&nbsp; Man lived
hard in those days, under dark skies, in houses&mdash;even the
most luxurious of them&mdash;which we should think, from draughts
and darkness, unfit for felons&rsquo; cells.&nbsp; Hardly they
lived; and easily were they pleased, and thankful to God for the
least gleam of sunshine, the least patch of green, after the
terrible and long winters of the Middle Age.&nbsp; And ugly
enough those winters must have been, what with snow-storm and
darkness, flood and ice, ague and rheumatism; while through the
long drear winter nights the whistle of the wind and the wild
cries of the water-fowl were translated into the howls of witches
and demons; and (as in St. Guthlac&rsquo;s case) the delirious
fancies of marsh fever made fiends take hideous shapes before the
inner eye, and act fantastic horrors round the old
fen-man&rsquo;s bed of sedge.</p>
<p>The Romans seem to have done something toward the draining and
embanking of this dismal swamp.&nbsp; To them is attributed the
car-dyke, or catch-water drain, which runs for many miles from
Peterborough northward into Lincolnshire, cutting off the land
waters which flow down from the wolds above.&nbsp; To them, too,
is to be attributed the old Roman bank, or &lsquo;vallum,&rsquo;
along the sea-face of the marshlands, marked to this day by the
names of Walsoken, Walton, and Walpoole.&nbsp; But the English
invaders were incapable of following out, even of preserving, any
public works.&nbsp; Each village was isolated by its own
&lsquo;march&rsquo; of forest; each yeoman all but isolated by
the &lsquo;eaves-drip,&rsquo; or green lane round his farm.&nbsp;
Each &lsquo;cared for his own things, and none for those of
others;&rsquo; and gradually, during the early Middle Age, the
fen&mdash;save those old Roman villages&mdash;returned to its
prim&aelig;val jungle, under the neglect of a race which
caricatured local self-government into public anarchy, and looked
on every stranger as an alien enemy, who might be lawfully slain,
if he came through the forest without calling aloud or blowing a
horn.&nbsp; Till late years, the English feeling against the
stranger lasted harsh and strong.&nbsp; The farmer, strong in his
laws of settlement, tried at once to pass him into the next
parish.&nbsp; The labourer, not being versed in law, hove half a
brick at him, or hooted him through the town.&nbsp; It was in the
fens, perhaps, that the necessity of combined effort for fighting
the brute powers of nature first awakened public spirit, and
associate labour, and the sense of a common interest between men
of different countries and races.</p>
<p>But the progress was very slow; and the first civilizers of
the fen were men who had nothing less in their minds than to
conquer nature, or call together round them communities of
men.&nbsp; Hermits, driven by that passion for isolated
independence which is the mark of the Teutonic mind, fled into
the wilderness, where they might, if possible, be alone with God
and their own souls.&nbsp; Like St. Guthlac of Crowland, after
wild fighting for five-and-twenty years, they longed for peace
and solitude; and from their longing, carried out with that iron
will which marked the medi&aelig;val man for good or for evil,
sprang a civilization of which they never dreamed.</p>
<p>Those who wish to understand the old fen life, should read
Ingulf&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Crowland&rsquo; (Mr. Bohn has
published a good and cheap translation), and initiate themselves
into a state of society, a form of thought, so utterly different
from our own, that we seem to be reading of the inhabitants of
another planet.&nbsp; Most amusing and most human is old Ingulf
and his continuator, &lsquo;Peter of Blois;&rsquo; and though
their facts are not to be depended on as having actually
happened, they are still instructive, as showing what might, or
ought to have happened, in the opinion of the men of old.</p>
<p>Even more na&iuml;ve is the Anglo-Saxon life of St. Guthlac,
written possibly as early as the eighth century, and literally
translated by Mr. Goodwin, of Cambridge.</p>
<p>There we may read how the young warrior-noble, Guthlac
(&lsquo;The Battle-Play,&rsquo; the &lsquo;Sport of War&rsquo;),
tired of slaying and sinning, bethought him to fulfil the
prodigies seen at his birth; how he wandered into the fen, where
one Tatwin (who after became a saint likewise) took him in his
canoe to a spot so lonely as to be almost unknown, buried in
reeds and alders; and among the trees, nought but an old
&lsquo;law,&rsquo; as the Scots still call a mound, which men of
old had broken into seeking for treasure, and a little pond; and
how he built himself a hermit&rsquo;s cell thereon, and saw
visions and wrought miracles; and how men came to him, as to a
fakir or shaman of the East; notably one Beccel, who acted as his
servant; and how as Beccel was shaving the saint one day, there
fell on him a great temptation: Why should he not cut St.
Guthlac&rsquo;s throat, and install himself in his cell, that he
might have the honour and glory of sainthood?&nbsp; But St.
Guthlac perceived the inward temptation (which is told with the
na&iuml;ve honesty of those half-savage times), and rebuked the
offender into confession, and all went well to the end.</p>
<p>There we may read, too, a detailed account of a Fauna now
happily extinct in the fens: of the creatures who used to hale
St. Guthlac out of his hut, drag him through the bogs, carry him
aloft through frost and fire&mdash;&lsquo;Develen and luther
gostes&rsquo;&mdash;such as tormented likewise St. Botolph (from
whom Botulfston=Boston, has its name), and who were supposed to
haunt the meres and fens, and to have an especial fondness for
old heathen barrows with their fancied treasure hoards; how they
&lsquo;filled the house with their coming, and poured in on every
side, from above, and from beneath, and everywhere.&nbsp; They
were in countenance horrible, and they had great heads, and a
long neck, and a lean visage; they were filthy and squalid in
their beards, and they had rough ears, and crooked nebs, and
fierce eyes, and foul mouths; and their teeth were like
horses&rsquo; tusks; and their throats were filled with flame,
and they were grating in their voice; they had crooked shanks,
and knees big and great behind, and twisted toes, and cried
hoarsely with their voices; and they came with such immoderate
noise and immense horror, that him thought all between heaven and
earth resounded with their voices.&nbsp; And they tugged and led
him out of the cot, and led him to the swart fen, and threw and
sunk him in the muddy waters.&nbsp; After that they brought him
into the wild places of the wilderness, among the thick beds of
brambles, that all his body was torn.&nbsp; After that they took
him and beat him with iron whips; and after that they brought him
on their creaking wings between the cold regions of the
air.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But there are gentler and more human touches in that old
legend.&nbsp; You may read in it, how all the wild birds of the
fen came to St. Guthlac, and he fed them after their kind.&nbsp;
How the ravens tormented him, stealing letters, gloves, and what
not, from his visitors; and then, seized with compunction at his
reproofs, brought them back, or hanged them on the reeds; and
how, as Wilfrid, a holy visitant, was sitting with him,
discoursing of the contemplative life, two swallows came flying
in, and lifted up their song, sitting now on the saint&rsquo;s
hand, now on his shoulder, now on his knee.&nbsp; And how, when
Wilfrid wondered thereat, Guthlac made answer, &lsquo;Know you
not that he who hath led his life according to God&rsquo;s will,
to him the wild beasts and the wild birds draw the more
near.&rsquo;</p>
<p>After fifteen years of such a life, in fever, agues, and
starvation, no wonder if St. Guthlac died.&nbsp; They buried him
in a leaden coffin (a grand and expensive luxury in the seventh
century) which had been sent to him during his life by a Saxon
princess; and then, over his sacred and wonder-working corpse, as
over that of a Buddhist saint, there rose a chapel, with a
community of monks, companies of pilgrims who came to worship,
sick who came to be healed; till, at last, founded on great piles
driven into the bog, arose the lofty wooden Abbey of Crowland; in
its sanctuary of the four rivers, its dykes, parks, vineyards,
orchards, rich ploughlands, from which, in time of famine, the
monks of Crowland fed all people of the neighbouring fens; with
its tower with seven bells, which had not their like in England;
its twelve altars rich with the gifts of Danish Vikings and
princes, and even with twelve white bear-skins, the gift of
Canute&rsquo;s self; while all around were the cottages of the
corrodiers, or folk who, for a corrody, or life pittance from the
abbey, had given away their lands, to the wrong and detriment of
their heirs.</p>
<p>But within these four rivers, at least, was neither tyranny
nor slavery.&nbsp; Those who took refuge in St. Guthlac&rsquo;s
peace from cruel lords must keep his peace toward each other, and
earn their living like honest men, safe while they did so; for
between those four rivers St. Guthlac and his abbot were the only
lords, and neither summoner, nor sheriff of the king, nor armed
force of knight or earl, could enter &lsquo;the inheritance of
the Lord, the soil of St. Mary and St. Bartholomew, the most holy
sanctuary of St. Guthlac and his monks; the minster free from
worldly servitude; the special almshouse of most illustrious
kings; the sole refuge of anyone in worldly tribulation; the
perpetual abode of the saints; the possession of religious men,
specially set apart by the common council of the realm; by reason
of the frequent miracles of the holy confessor St. Guthlac, an
ever-fruitful mother of camphire in the vineyards of Engedi; and
by reason of the privileges granted by the kings, a city of grace
and safety to all who repent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Does not all this sound&mdash;as I said just now&mdash;like a
voice from another planet?&nbsp; It is all gone; and it was good
and right that it should go when it had done its work, and that
the civilization of the fen should be taken up and carried out by
men like the good knight, Richard of Rulos, who, two generations
after the Conquest, marrying Hereward&rsquo;s granddaughter, and
becoming Lord of Deeping (the deep meadow), thought that he could
do the same work from the hall of Bourne as the monks did from
their cloisters; got permission from the Crowland monks, for
twenty marks of silver, to drain as much as he could of the
common marshes; and then shut out the Welland by strong dykes,
built cottages, marked out gardens, and tilled fields, till
&lsquo;out of slough and bogs accursed, he made a garden of
pleasure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yet one lasting work those monks of Crowland did, besides
those firm dykes and rich corn lands of the Porsand, which endure
unto this day.&nbsp; For within two generations of the Norman
conquest, while the old wooden abbey, destroyed by fire, was
being replaced by that noble pile of stone whose ruins are still
standing, the French abbot of Crowland sent French monks to open
a school under the new French donjon, in the little Roman town of
Grante-brigge; whereby&mdash;so does all earnest work, however
mistaken, grow and spread in this world, infinitely and for
ever&mdash;St. Guthlac, by his canoe-voyage into Crowland Island,
became the spiritual father of the University of Cambridge in the
old world; and therefore of her noble daughter, the University of
Cambridge, in the new world which fen-men, sailing from Boston
deeps, colonized and Christianized, 800 years after St.
Guthlac&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The drainage of the fens struggled on for these same 800 years
slowly, and often disastrously.&nbsp; Great mistakes were made;
as when a certain bishop, some 700 years ago, bethought him to
make a cut from Littleport drain to Rebeck (or
Priests&rsquo;-houses), and found, to his horror and that of the
fen-men, that he had let down upon Lynn the pent-up waters of the
whole higher bogs; that rivers were running backwards, brooks
swelling to estuaries, and the whole north-eastern fen ruinate,
to be yet more ruinate by banks confusedly thrown up in
self-defence, till some order was restored in 1332, and the fens
prospered&mdash;such little of them as could be drained at
all&mdash;for nigh two hundred years.&nbsp; Honour, meanwhile, to
another prelate, good Bishop Morton, who cut the great learn from
Guyhirn&mdash;the last place at which one could see a standing
gallows, and two Irish reapers hanging in chains, having murdered
the old witch of Guyhirn for the sake of hidden treasure, which
proved to be some thirty shillings and a few silver spoons.</p>
<p>The belief is more general than well-founded that the drainage
of the fens retrograded on account of the dissolution of the
monasteries.&nbsp; The state of decay into which those
institutions had already fallen, and which alone made their
dissolution possible, must have extended itself to these
fen-lands.&nbsp; No one can read the account of their debts,
neglect, malversation of funds, in the time of Henry VIII.,
without seeing that the expensive works necessary to keep
fen-lands dry must have suffered, as did everything else
belonging to the convents.</p>
<p>It was not till the middle or end of Elizabeth&rsquo;s reign
that the recovery of these &lsquo;drowned lands&rsquo; was
proceeded with once more; and during the first half of the
seventeenth century there went on, more and more rapidly, that
great series of artificial works which, though often faulty in
principle, often unexpectedly disastrous in effect, have got the
work done, as all work is done in this world, not as well as it
should have been done, but at least done.</p>
<p>To comprehend those works would be impossible without maps and
plans; to take a lively interest in them impossible, likewise,
save to an engineer or a fen-man.&nbsp; Suffice it to say, that
in the early part of the seventeenth century we find a great
company of adventurers&mdash;more than one Cromwell among them,
and Francis, the great and good Earl of Bedford, at their
head&mdash;trying to start a great scheme for draining the
drowned &lsquo;middle level&rsquo; east of the Isle of Ely.&nbsp;
How they sent for Vermuyden, the Dutchman, who had been draining
in North Lincolnshire, about Goole and Axholme Isle; how they got
into his hands, and were ruined by him; how Francis of Bedford
had to sell valuable estates to pay his share; how the fen-men
looked on Francis of Bedford as their champion; how Charles I.
persecuted him meanly, though indeed Bedford had, in the matter
of the &lsquo;Lynn Law&rsquo; of 1630, given way, as desperate
men are tempted to do, to something like sharp practice unworthy
of him; how Charles took the work into his hands, and made a
Government job of it; how Bedford died, and the fen-men looked on
him as a martyr; how Oliver Cromwell arose to avenge the good
earl, as his family had supported him in past times; how Oliver
St. John came to the help of the fen-men, and drew up the
so-called &lsquo;Pretended Ordinance&rsquo; of 1649, which was a
compromise between Vermuyden and the adventurers, so able and
useful that Charles II.&rsquo;s Government were content to call
it &lsquo;pretended&rsquo; and let it stand, because it was
actually draining the fens; and how Sir Cornelius Vermuyden,
after doing mighty works, and taking mighty moneys, died a
beggar, writing petitions which never got answered; how William,
Earl of Bedford, added, in 1649, to his father&rsquo;s &lsquo;old
Bedford River&rsquo; that noble parallel river, the Hundred foot,
both rising high above the land between dykes and
&lsquo;washes,&rsquo; <i>i.e.</i> waste spaces right and left, to
allow for flood water; how the Great Bedford Rivers silted up the
mouth of the Ouse, and backed the floods up the Cam; how Denver
sluice was built to keep them back; and so forth,&mdash;all is
written, or rather only half or quarter written, in the histories
of the fens.</p>
<p>Another matter equally, or even more important, is but half
written&mdash;indeed, only hinted at&mdash;the mixed population
of the fens.</p>
<p>The sturdy old &lsquo;Girvii,&rsquo; &lsquo;Gyrwas,&rsquo; men
of the &lsquo;gyras&rsquo; or marshes, who in Hereward&rsquo;s
time sang their three-man glees, &lsquo;More Girviorum
tripliciter canentes,&rsquo; had been crossed with the blood of
Scandinavian Vikings in Canute&rsquo;s conquest; crossed again
with English refugees from all quarters during the French
conquest under William.&nbsp; After the St. Bartholomew they
received a fresh cross of Huguenot, fleeing from
France&mdash;dark-haired, fiery, earnest folk, whose names and
physiognomies are said still to remain about Wisbeach,
Whittlesea, and Thorney.&nbsp; Then came Vermuyden&rsquo;s
Dutchmen, leaving some of their blood behind them.&nbsp; After
the battle of Dunbar another cross came among them, of Scotch
prisoners, who, employed by Cromwell&rsquo;s Government on the
dykes, settled down among the fen-men to this day.&nbsp; Within
the memory of man, Scotchmen used to come down into the fens
every year, not merely for harvest, but to visit their
expatriated kinsmen.</p>
<p>To these successive immigrations of strong Puritan blood, more
than even the influence of the Cromwells and other Puritan
gentlemen, we may attribute that strong Calvinist element which
has endured for now nigh three centuries in the fen; and
attribute, too, that sturdy independence and self-help which
drove them of old out of Boston town, to seek their fortunes
first in Holland, then in Massachusetts over sea.&nbsp; And that
sturdy independence and self-help is not gone.&nbsp; There still
lives in them some of the spirit of their mythic giant Hickafrid
(the Hickathrift of nursery rhymes), who, when the Marshland men
(possibly the Romanized inhabitants of the wall villages)
quarrelled with him in the field, took up the cart-axle for a
club, smote them hip and thigh, and pastured his cattle in their
despite in the green cheese-fens of the Smeeth.&nbsp; No one has
ever seen a fen-bank break, without honouring the stern quiet
temper which there is in these men, when the north-easter is
howling above, the spring-tide roaring outside, the brimming
tide-way lapping up to the dyke-top, or flying over in sheets of
spray; when round the one fatal thread which is trickling over
the dyke&mdash;or worse, through some forgotten rat&rsquo;s hole
in its side&mdash;hundreds of men are clustered, without tumult,
without complaint, marshalled under their employers, fighting the
brute powers of nature, not for their employer&rsquo;s sake
alone, but for the sake of their own year&rsquo;s labour and
their own year&rsquo;s bread.&nbsp; The sheep have been driven
off the land below; the cattle stand ranged shivering on high
dykes inland; they will be saved in punts, if the worst
befall.&nbsp; But a hundred spades, wielded by practised hands,
cannot stop that tiny rat-hole.&nbsp; The trickle becomes a
rush&mdash;the rush a roaring waterfall.&nbsp; The dyke-top
trembles&mdash;gives.&nbsp; The men make efforts, desperate,
dangerous, as of sailors in a wreck, with faggots, hurdles,
sedge, turf: but the bank will break; and slowly they draw off;
sullen, but uncomplaining; beaten, but not conquered.&nbsp; A new
cry rises among them.&nbsp; Up, to save yonder sluice; that will
save yonder lode; that again yonder farm; that again some other
lode, some other farm, far back inland, but guessed at instantly
by men who have studied from their youth, as the necessity of
their existence, the labyrinthine drainage of lands which are all
below the water level, and where the inner lands, in many cases,
are lower still than those outside.</p>
<p>So they hurry away to the nearest farms; the teams are
harnessed, the waggons filled, and drawn down and emptied; the
beer-cans go round cheerily, and the men work with a sort of
savage joy at being able to do something, if not all, and stop
the sluice on which so much depends.&nbsp; As for the outer land,
it is gone past hope; through the breach pours a roaring salt
cataract, digging out a hole on the inside of the bank, which
remains as a deep sullen pond for years to come.&nbsp; Hundreds,
thousands of pounds are lost already, past all hope.&nbsp; Be it
so, then.&nbsp; At the next neap, perhaps, they will be able to
mend the dyke, and pump the water out; and begin again, beaten
but not conquered, the same everlasting fight with wind and wave
which their forefathers have waged for now 800 years.</p>
<p>He who sees&mdash;as I have seen&mdash;a sight like that, will
repine no more that the prim&aelig;val forest is cut down, the
fair mere drained.&nbsp; For instead of mammoth and urus, stag
and goat, that fen feeds cattle many times more numerous than all
the wild venison of the prim&aelig;val jungle; and produces crops
capable of nourishing a hundred times as many human beings; and
more&mdash;it produces men a hundred times as numerous as ever it
produced before; more healthy and long-lived&mdash;and if they
will, more virtuous and more happy&mdash;than ever was Girvian in
his log-canoe, or holy hermit in his cell.&nbsp; So we, who knew
the deep fen, will breathe one sigh over the last scrap of
wilderness, and say no more; content to know that&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The old order changeth, yielding place to
new,<br />
And God fulfils himself in many ways,<br />
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.&rsquo;</p>

WINTER GARDEN. <a name="citation135"></a><a href="#footnote135"
class="citation">[135]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">So</span>, my friend: you ask me to tell
you how I contrive to support this monotonous country life; how,
fond as I am of excitement, adventure, society, scenery, art,
literature, I go cheerfully through the daily routine of a
commonplace country profession, never requiring a
six-weeks&rsquo; holiday; not caring to see the Continent, hardly
even to spend a day in London; having never yet actually got to
Paris.</p>
<p>You wonder why I do not grow dull as those round me, whose
talk is of bullocks&mdash;as indeed mine is, often enough; why I
am not by this time &lsquo;all over blue mould;&rsquo; why I have
not been tempted to bury myself in my study, and live a life of
dreams among old books.</p>
<p>I will tell you.&nbsp; I am a minute philosopher: though one,
thank Heaven, of a different stamp from him whom the great Bishop
Berkeley silenced&mdash;alas! only for a while. I am possibly,
after all, a man of small mind, content with small
pleasures.&nbsp; So much the better for me.&nbsp; Meanwhile, I
can understand your surprise, though you cannot understand my
content.&nbsp; You have played a greater game than mine; have
lived a life, perhaps more fit for an Englishman; certainly more
in accordance with the taste of our common fathers, the Vikings,
and their patron Odin &lsquo;the goer,&rsquo; father of all them
that go ahead.&nbsp; You have gone ahead, and over many lands;
and I reverence you for it, though I envy you not.&nbsp; You have
commanded a regiment&mdash;indeed an army, and &lsquo;drank
delight of battle with your peers;&rsquo; you have ruled
provinces, and done justice and judgment, like a noble Englishman
as you are, old friend, among thousands who never knew before
what justice and judgment were.&nbsp; You have tasted (and you
have deserved to taste) the joy of old David&rsquo;s psalm, when
he has hunted down the last of the robber lords of
Palestine.&nbsp; You have seen &lsquo;a people whom you have not
known, serve you.&nbsp; As soon as they heard of you, they obeyed
you; but the strange children dissembled with you:&rsquo; yet
before you, too, &lsquo;the strange children failed, and trembled
in their hill-forts.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Noble work that was to do, and nobly you have done it; and I
do not wonder that to a man who has been set to such a task, and
given power to carry it through, all smaller work must seem
paltry; that such a man&rsquo;s very amusements, in that grand
Indian land, and that free adventurous Indian life, exciting the
imagination, calling out all the self-help and daring of a man,
should have been on a par with your work; that when you go a
sporting, you ask for no meaner preserve than the prim&aelig;val
forest, no lower park wall than the snow-peaks of the
Himalaya.</p>
<p>Yes; you have been a &lsquo;burra Shikarree&rsquo; as well as
a &lsquo;burra Sahib.&rsquo;&nbsp; You have played the great game
in your work, and killed the great game in your play.&nbsp; How
many tons of mighty monsters have you done to death, since we two
were schoolboys together, five-and-twenty years ago?&nbsp; How
many starving villages have you fed with the flesh of elephant or
buffalo?&nbsp; How many have you delivered from man-eating
tigers, or wary old alligators, their craws full of poor
girls&rsquo; bangles?&nbsp; Have you not been charged by
rhinoceroses, all but ript up by boars?&nbsp; Have you not seen
face to face Ovis Ammon himself, the giant mountain
sheep&mdash;prim&aelig;val ancestor, perhaps, of all the flocks
on earth?&nbsp; Your memories must be like those of Theseus and
Hercules, full of slain monsters.&nbsp; Your brains must be one
fossiliferous deposit, in which gaur and sambur, hog and tiger,
rhinoceros and elephant, lie heaped together, as the old
ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs are heaped in the lias rocks at
Lyme.&nbsp; And therefore I like to think of you.&nbsp; I try to
picture your feelings to myself.&nbsp; I spell over with my boy
Mayne Reid&rsquo;s amusing books, or the &lsquo;Old Forest
Ranger,&rsquo; or Williams&rsquo;s old &lsquo;Tiger Book,&rsquo;
with Howitt&rsquo;s plates; and try to realize the glory of a
burra Shikarree: and as I read and imagine, feel, with Sir Hugh
Evans, &lsquo;a great disposition to cry.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For there were times, full many a year ago, when my brains
were full of bison and grizzly bear, mustang and big-horn,
Blackfoot and Pawnee, and hopes of wild adventure in the Far
West, which I shall never see; for ere I was three-and-twenty, I
discovered, plainly enough, that my lot was to stay at home and
earn my bread in a very quiet way; that England was to be
henceforth my prison or my palace, as I should choose to make it:
and I have made it, by Heaven&rsquo;s help, the latter.</p>
<p>I will confess to you, though, that in those first heats of
youth, this little England&mdash;or rather, this little patch of
moor in which I have struck roots as firm as the wild fir-trees
do&mdash;looked at moments rather like a prison than a palace;
that my foolish young heart would sigh, &lsquo;Oh! that I had
wings&rsquo;&mdash;not as a dove, to fly home to its nest and
croodle there&mdash;but as an eagle, to swoop away over land and
sea, in a rampant and self-glorifying fashion, on which I now
look back as altogether unwholesome and undesirable.&nbsp; But
the thirst for adventure and excitement was strong in me, as
perhaps it ought to be in all at twenty-one.&nbsp; Others went
out to see the glorious new worlds of the West, the glorious old
worlds of the East&mdash;why should not I?&nbsp; Others rambled
over Alps and Apennines, Italian picture-galleries and palaces,
filling their minds with fair memories&mdash;why should not
I?&nbsp; Others discovered new wonders in botany and
zoology&mdash;why should not I?&nbsp; Others too, like you,
fulfilled to the utmost that strange lust after the burra shikar,
which even now makes my pulse throb as often as I see the
stags&rsquo; heads in our friend A&mdash;&rsquo;s hall: why
should not I?&nbsp; It is not learnt in a day, the golden lesson
of the Old Collect, to &lsquo;love the thing which is commanded,
and desire that which is promised.&rsquo;&nbsp; Not in a day: but
in fifteen years one can spell out a little of its worth; and
when one finds one&rsquo;s self on the wrong side of forty, and
the first grey hairs begin to show on the temples, and one can no
longer jump as high as one&rsquo;s third button&mdash;scarcely,
alas! to any button at all; and what with innumerable sprains,
bruises, soakings, and chillings, one&rsquo;s lower limbs feel in
a cold thaw much like an old post-horse&rsquo;s, why, one makes a
virtue of necessity: and if one still lusts after sights, takes
the nearest, and looks for wonders, not in the Himalayas or Lake
Ngami, but in the turf on the lawn and the brook in the park; and
with good Alphonse Karr enjoys the macro-microcosm in one
&lsquo;Tour autour de mon jardin.&rsquo;</p>
<p>For there it is, friend, the whole infinite miracle of nature
in every tuft of grass, if we have only eyes to see it, and can
disabuse our minds of that tyrannous phantom of size.&nbsp; Only
recollect that great and small are but relative terms; that in
truth nothing is great or small, save in proportion to the
quantity of creative thought which has been exercised in making
it; that the fly who basks upon one of the trilithons of
Stonehenge, is in truth infinitely greater than all Stonehenge
together, though he may measure the tenth of an inch, and the
stone on which he sits five-and-twenty feet.&nbsp; You differ
from me?&nbsp; Be it so.&nbsp; Even if you prove me wrong I will
believe myself in the right: I cannot afford to do
otherwise.&nbsp; If you rob me of my faith in &lsquo;minute
philosophy,&rsquo; you rob me of a continual source of content,
surprise, delight.</p>
<p>So go your way and I mine, each working with all his might,
and playing with all his might, in his own place and way.&nbsp;
Remember only, that though I never can come round to your sphere,
you must some day come round to me, when wounds, or weariness, or
merely, as I hope, a healthy old age, shall shut you out for once
and for all from burra shikar, whether human or
quadruped.&mdash;For you surely will not take to politics in your
old age?&nbsp; You will not surely live to solicit (as many a
fine fellow, alas! did but last year) the votes, not even of the
people, but merely of the snobocracy, on the ground of your
having neither policy nor principles, nor even opinions, upon any
matter in heaven or earth?&mdash;Then in that day will you be
forced, my friend, to do what I have done this many a year; to
refrain your soul, and keep it low.&nbsp; You will see more and
more the depth of human ignorance, the vanity of human
endeavours.&nbsp; You will feel more and more that the world is
going God&rsquo;s way, and not yours, or mine, or any
man&rsquo;s; and that if you have been allowed to do good work on
earth, that work is probably as different from what you fancy it
as the tree is from the seed whence it springs.&nbsp; You will
grow content, therefore, not to see the real fruit of your
labours; because if you saw it you would probably be frightened
at it, and what is very good in the eyes of God would not be very
good in yours; content, also, to receive your discharge, and work
and fight no more, sure that God is working and fighting, whether
you are in hospital or in the field.&nbsp; And with this growing
sense of the pettiness of human struggles will grow on you a
respect for simple labours, a thankfulness for simple pleasures,
a sympathy with simple people, and possibly, my trusty friend,
with me and my little tours about that moorland which I call my
winter-garden, and which is to me as full of glory and of
instruction as the Himalaya or the Punjab are to you, and in
which I contrive to find as much health and amusement as I have
time for&mdash;and who ought to have more?</p>
<p>I call the said garden mine, not because I own it in any legal
sense (for only in a few acres have I a life interest), but in
that higher sense in which ten thousand people can own the same
thing, and yet no man&rsquo;s right interfere with
another&rsquo;s.&nbsp; To whom does the Apollo Belvedere belong,
but to all who have eyes to see its beauty?&nbsp; So does my
winter-garden; and therefore to me among the rest.</p>
<p>Besides (which is a gain to a poor man) my pleasure in it is a
very cheap one.&nbsp; So are all those of a minute philosopher,
except his microscope.&nbsp; But my winter-garden, which is far
larger, at all events, than that famous one at Chatsworth, costs
me not one penny in keeping up.&nbsp; Poor, did I call
myself?&nbsp; Is it not true wealth to have all I want without
paying for it?&nbsp; Is it not true wealth, royal wealth, to have
some twenty gentlemen and noblemen, nay, even royal personages,
planting and improving for me?&nbsp; Is it not more than royal
wealth to have sun and frost, Gulf-stream and south-westers, laws
of geology, phytology, physiology, and other ologies&mdash;in a
word, the whole universe and the powers thereof, day and night,
paving, planting, roofing, lighting, colouring my winter-garden
for me, without my even having the trouble to rub a magic ring
and tell the genii to go to work?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; I am very rich, as every man may be who will.&nbsp;
In the doings of our little country neighbourhood I find tragedy
and comedy, too fantastic, sometimes too sad, to be written
down.&nbsp; In the words of those whose talk is of bullocks, I
find the materials of all possible metaphysic, and long weekly
that I had time to work them out.&nbsp; In fifteen miles of
moorland I find the materials of all possible physical science,
and long that I had time to work out one smallest segment of that
great sphere.&nbsp; How can I be richer, if I have lying at my
feet all day a thousand times more wealth than I can use?</p>
<p>Some people&mdash;most people&mdash;in these run-about railway
days, would complain of such a life, in such a &lsquo;narrow
sphere,&rsquo; so they call it, as monotonous.&nbsp; Very likely
it is so.&nbsp; But is it to be complained of on that
account?&nbsp; Is monotony in itself an evil?&nbsp; Which is
better, to know many places ill, or to know one place well?&nbsp;
Certainly&mdash;if a scientific habit of mind be a gain&mdash;it
is only by exhausting as far as possible the significance of an
individual phenomenon (is not that sentence a true scientific one
in its magniloquence?) that you can discover any glimpse of the
significance of the universal.&nbsp; Even men of boundless
knowledge, like Humboldt, must have had once their speciality,
their pet subject, or they would have, strictly speaking, no
knowledge at all.&nbsp; The volcanoes of Mexico, patiently and
laboriously investigated in his youth, were to Humboldt,
possibly, the key of the whole Cosmos.&nbsp; I learn more,
studying over and over again the same Bagshot sand and gravel
heaps, than I should by roaming all Europe in search of new
geologic wonders.&nbsp; Fifteen years have I been puzzling at the
same questions and have only guessed at a few of the
answers.&nbsp; What sawed out the edges of the moors into long
narrow banks of gravel?&nbsp; What cut them off all flat
atop?&nbsp; What makes <i>Erica Tetralix</i> grow in one soil,
and the bracken in another?&nbsp; How did three species of
Club-moss&mdash;one of them quite an Alpine one&mdash;get down
here, all the way from Wales perhaps, upon this isolated patch of
gravel?&nbsp; Why did that one patch of <i>Carex arenaria</i>
settle in the only square yard for miles and miles which bore
sufficient resemblance to its native sandhill by the seashore, to
make it comfortable?&nbsp; Why did <i>Myosurus minimus</i>, which
I had hunted for in vain for fourteen years, appear by dozens in
the fifteenth, upon a new-made bank, which had been for at least
two hundred years a farm-yard gateway?&nbsp; Why does it
generally rain here from the south-west, not when the barometer
falls, but when it begins to rise again?&nbsp; Why&mdash;why is
everything, which lies under my feet all day long?&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t know; and you can&rsquo;t tell me.&nbsp; And till I
have found out, I cannot complain of monotony, with still
undiscovered puzzles waiting to be explained, and so to create
novelty at every turn.</p>
<p>Besides, monotony is pleasant in itself; morally pleasant, and
morally useful.&nbsp; Marriage is monotonous: but there is much,
I trust, to be said in favour of holy wedlock.&nbsp; Living in
the same house is monotonous: but three removes, say the wise,
are as bad as a fire.&nbsp; Locomotion is regarded as an evil by
our Litany.&nbsp; The Litany, as usual, is right.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Those who travel by land or sea&rsquo; are to be objects
of our pity and our prayers; and I do pity them.&nbsp; I delight
in that same monotony.&nbsp; It saves curiosity, anxiety,
excitement, disappointment, and a host of bad passions.&nbsp; It
gives a man the blessed, invigorating feeling that he is at home;
that he has roots, deep and wide, struck down into all he sees;
and that only The Being who will do nothing cruel or useless can
tear them up.&nbsp; It is pleasant to look down on the same
parish day after day, and say, I know all that lies beneath, and
all beneath know me.&nbsp; If I want a friend, I know where to
find him; if I want work done, I know who will do it.&nbsp; It is
pleasant and good to see the same trees year after year; the same
birds coming back in spring to the same shrubs; the same banks
covered with the same flowers, and broken (if they be stiff ones)
by the same gaps.&nbsp; Pleasant and good it is to ride the same
horse, to sit in the same chair, to wear the same old coat.&nbsp;
That man who offered twenty pounds&rsquo; reward for a lost
carpet-bag full of old boots was a sage, and I wish I knew
him.&nbsp; Why should one change one&rsquo;s place, any more than
one&rsquo;s wife or one&rsquo;s children?&nbsp; Is a hermit-crab,
slipping his tail out of one strange shell into another, in the
hopes of its fitting him a little better, either a dignified,
safe, or graceful animal?&nbsp; No; George Riddler was a true
philosopher.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Let vules go sarching vur and nigh,<br />
We bides at Whum, my dog and I;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and become there, not only wiser, but more charitable; for the
oftener one sees, the better one knows; and the better one knows,
the more one loves.</p>
<p>It is an easy philosophy; especially in the case of the horse,
where a man cannot afford more than one, as I cannot.&nbsp; To
own a stud of horses, after all, is not to own horses at all, but
riding-machines.&nbsp; Your rich man who rides Crim&aelig;a in
the morning, Sir Guy in the afternoon, and Sultan to-morrow, and
something else the next day, may be a very gallant rider: but it
is a question whether he enjoys the pleasure which one horse
gives to the poor man who rides him day after day; one horse, who
is not a slave, but a friend; who has learnt all his tricks of
voice, hand, heel, and knows what his master wants, even without
being told; who will bear with his master&rsquo;s infirmities,
and feels secure that his master will bear with his in turn.</p>
<p>Possibly, after all, the grapes are sour; and were one rich,
one would do even as the rich are wont to do: but still, I am a
minute philosopher.&nbsp; And therefore, this afternoon, after I
have done the same work, visited the same people, and said the
same words to them, which I have done for years past, and shall,
I trust, for many a year to come, I shall go wandering out into
the same winter-garden on the same old mare; and think the same
thoughts, and see the same fir-trees, and meet perhaps the same
good fellows hunting of their fox, as I have done with full
content this many a year; and rejoice, as I said before, in my
own boundless wealth, who have the whole universe to look at,
without being charged one penny for the show.</p>
<p>As I have said, the grapes may be sour, and I enjoy the want
of luxuries only because I cannot get them; but if my
self-deception be useful to me, leave it alone.</p>
<p>No one is less inclined to depreciate that magnificent
winter-garden at the Crystal Palace: yet let me, if I choose,
prefer my own; I argue that, in the first place, it is far
larger.&nbsp; You may drive, I hear, through the grand one at
Chatsworth for a quarter of a mile.&nbsp; You may ride through
mine for fifteen miles on end.&nbsp; I prefer, too, to any glass
roof which Sir Joseph Paxton ever planned, that dome above my
head some three miles high, of soft dappled grey and yellow
cloud, through the vast lattice-work whereof the blue sky peeps,
and sheds down tender gleams on yellow bogs, and softly rounded
heather knolls, and pale chalk ranges gleaming far away.&nbsp;
But, above all, I glory in my evergreens.&nbsp; What
winter-garden can compare for them with mine?&nbsp; True, I have
but four kinds&mdash;Scotch fir, holly, furze, and the heath; and
by way of relief to them, only brows of brown fern, sheets of
yellow bog-grass, and here and there a leafless birch, whose
purple tresses are even more lovely to my eye than those fragrant
green ones which she puts on in spring.&nbsp; Well: in painting
as in music, what effects are more grand than those produced by
the scientific combination, in endless new variety, of a few
simple elements?&nbsp; Enough for me is the one purple birch; the
bright hollies round its stem sparkling with scarlet beads; the
furze-patch, rich with its lacework of interwoven light and
shade, tipped here and there with a golden bud; the deep soft
heather carpet, which invites you to lie down and dream for
hours; and behind all, the wall of red fir-stems, and the dark
fir-roof with its jagged edges a mile long, against the soft grey
sky.</p>
<p>An ugly, straight-edged, monotonous fir-plantation?&nbsp;
Well, I like it, outside and inside.&nbsp; I need no saw-edge of
mountain peaks to stir up my imagination with the sense of the
sublime, while I can watch the saw-edge of those fir peaks
against the red sunset.&nbsp; They are my Alps; little ones it
may be: but after all, as I asked before, what is size?&nbsp; A
phantom of our brain; an optical delusion.&nbsp; Grandeur, if you
will consider wisely, consists in form, and not in size: and to
the eye of the philosopher, the curve drawn on a paper two inches
long, is just as magnificent, just as symbolic of divine
mysteries and melodies, as when embodied in the span of some
cathedral roof.&nbsp; Have you eyes to see?&nbsp; Then lie down
on the grass, and look near enough to see something more of what
is to be seen; and you will find tropic jungles in every square
foot of turf; mountain cliffs and debacles at the mouth of every
rabbit burrow: dark strids, tremendous cataracts, &lsquo;deep
glooms and sudden glories,&rsquo; in every foot-broad rill which
wanders through the turf.&nbsp; All is there for you to see, if
you will but rid yourself of &lsquo;that idol of space;&rsquo;
and Nature, as everyone will tell you who has seen dissected an
insect under the microscope, is as grand and graceful in her
smallest as in her hugest forms.</p>
<p>The March breeze is chilly: but I can be always warm if I like
in my winter-garden.&nbsp; I turn my horse&rsquo;s head to the
red wall of fir-stems, and leap over the furze-grown bank into my
cathedral, wherein if there be no saints, there are likewise no
priestcraft and no idols; but endless vistas of smooth red
green-veined shafts holding up the warm dark roof, lessening away
into endless gloom, paved with rich brown fir-needle&mdash;a
carpet at which Nature has been at work for forty years.&nbsp;
Red shafts, green roof, and here and there a pane of blue
sky&mdash;neither Owen Jones nor Willement can improve upon that
ecclesiastical ornamentation,&mdash;while for incense I have the
fresh healthy turpentine fragrance, far sweeter to my nostrils
than the stifling narcotic odour which fills a Roman Catholic
cathedral.&nbsp; There is not a breath of air within: but the
breeze sighs over the roof above in a soft whisper.&nbsp; I shut
my eyes and listen.&nbsp; Surely that is the murmur of the summer
sea upon the summer sands in Devon far away.&nbsp; I hear the
innumerable wavelets spend themselves gently upon the shore, and
die away to rise again.&nbsp; And with the innumerable wave-sighs
come innumerable memories, and faces which I shall never see
again upon this earth.&nbsp; I will not tell even you of that,
old friend.</p>
<p>It has two notes, two keys rather, that Eolian-harp of
fir-needles above my head; according as the wind is east or west,
the needles dry or wet.&nbsp; This easterly key of to-day is
shriller, more cheerful, warmer in sound, though the day itself
be colder: but grander still, as well as softer, is the sad
soughing key in which the south-west wind roars on, rain-laden,
over the forest, and calls me forth&mdash;being a minute
philosopher&mdash;to catch trout in the nearest chalk-stream.</p>
<p>The breeze is gone a while; and I am in perfect
silence&mdash;a silence which may be heard.&nbsp; Not a sound;
and not a moving object; absolutely none.&nbsp; The absence of
animal life is solemn, startling.&nbsp; That ringdove, who was
cooing half a mile away, has hushed his moan; that flock of
long-tailed titmice, which were twinging and pecking about the
fir-cones a few minutes since, are gone: and now there is not
even a gnat to quiver in the slant sun-rays.&nbsp; Did a spider
run over these dead leaves, I almost fancy I could hear his
footfall.&nbsp; The creaking of the saddle, the soft step of the
mare upon the fir-needles, jar my ears.&nbsp; I seem alone in a
dead world.&nbsp; A dead world: and yet so full of life, if I had
eyes to see!&nbsp; Above my head every fir-needle is
breathing&mdash;breathing for ever; currents unnumbered circulate
in every bough, quickened by some undiscovered miracle; around me
every fir-stem is distilling strange juices, which no laboratory
of man can make; and where my dull eye sees only death, the eye
of God sees boundless life and motion, health and use.</p>
<p>Slowly I wander on beneath the warm roof of the winter-garden,
and meditate upon that one word&mdash;Life; and specially on all
that Mr. Lewes has written so well thereon&mdash;for
instance&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;We may consider Life itself as an
ever-increasing identification with Nature.&nbsp; The simple
cell, from which the plant or animal arises, must draw light and
heat from the sun, nutriment from the surrounding world, or else
it will remain quiescent, not alive, though latent with life; as
the grains in the Egyptian tombs, which after lying thousands of
years in those sepulchres, are placed in the earth, and smile
forth as golden wheat.&nbsp; What we call growth, is it not a
perpetual absorption of Nature, the identification of the
individual with the universal?&nbsp; And may we not, in
speculative moods, consider Death as the grand impatience of the
soul to free itself from the circle of individual
activity&mdash;the yearning of the creature to be united with the
Creator?</p>
<p>&lsquo;As with Life, so with knowledge, which is intellectual
life.&nbsp; In the early days of man&rsquo;s history, Nature and
her marvellous ongoings were regarded with but a casual and
careless eye, or else with the merest wonder.&nbsp; It was late
before profound and reverent study of her laws could wean man
from impatient speculations; and now, what is our intellectual
activity based on, except on the more thorough mental absorption
of Nature?&nbsp; When that absorption is completed, the mystic
drama will be sunny clear, and all Nature&rsquo;s processes be
visible to man, as a Divine Effluence and Life.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>True: yet not all the truth.&nbsp; But who knows all the
truth?</p>
<p>Not I.&nbsp; &lsquo;We see through a glass darkly,&rsquo; said
St. Paul of old; and what is more, dazzle and weary our eyes,
like clumsy microscopists, by looking too long and earnestly
through the imperfect and by no means achromatic lens.&nbsp;
Enough.&nbsp; I will think of something else.&nbsp; I will think
of nothing at all&mdash;</p>
<p>Stay.&nbsp; There was a sound at last; a light footfall.</p>
<p>A hare races towards us through the ferns, her great bright
eyes full of terror, her ears aloft to catch some sound
behind.&nbsp; She sees us, turns short, and vanishes into the
gloom.&nbsp; The mare pricks up her ears too, listens, and looks:
but not the way the hare has gone.&nbsp; There is something more
coming; I can trust the finer sense of the horse, to which (and
no wonder) the Middle Age attributed the power of seeing ghosts
and fairies impalpable to man&rsquo;s gross eyes.&nbsp; Beside,
that hare was not travelling in search of food.&nbsp; She was not
loping along, looking around her right and left; but galloping
steadily.&nbsp; She has been frightened; she has been put up: but
what has put her up?&nbsp; And there, far away among the
fir-stems, rings the shriek of a startled blackbird.&nbsp; What
has put him up?</p>
<p>That, old mare, at sight whereof your wise eyes widen till
they are ready to burst, and your ears are first shot forward
towards your nose, and then laid back with vicious intent.&nbsp;
Stand still, old woman!&nbsp; Do you think still, after fifteen
winters, that you can catch a fox?</p>
<p>A fox it is indeed; a great dog-fox, as red as the fir-stems
between which he glides.&nbsp; And yet his legs are black with
fresh peat-stains.&nbsp; He is a hunted fox: but he has not been
up long.</p>
<p>The mare stands like a statue: but I can feel her trembling
between my knees.&nbsp; Positively he does not see us.&nbsp; He
sits down in the middle of a ride, turns his great ears right and
left, and then scratches one of them with his hind foot,
seemingly to make it hear the better.&nbsp; Now he is up again
and on.</p>
<p>Beneath yon firs, some hundred yards away, standeth, or rather
lieth, for it is on dead flat ground, the famous castle of
Malepartus, which beheld the base murder of Lampe the hare, and
many a seely soul beside.&nbsp; I know it well; a patch of
sand-heaps, mingled with great holes, amid the twining fir-roots;
ancient home of the last of the wild beasts.&nbsp; And thither,
unto Malepartus safe and strong, trots Reinecke, where he hopes
to be snug among the labyrinthine windings, and innumerable
starting-holes, as the old apologue has it, of his ballium,
covert-way, and donjon keep.&nbsp; Full blown in
self-satisfaction he trots, lifting his toes delicately, and
carrying his brush aloft, as full of cunning and conceit as that
world-famous ancestor of his, whose deeds of unchivalry were the
delight, if not the model, of knight and kaiser, lady and
burgher, in the Middle Age.</p>
<p>Suddenly he halts at the great gate of Malepartus; examines it
with his nose; goes on to a postern; examines that also, and then
another, and another; while I perceive afar, projecting from
every cave&rsquo;s mouth, the red and green end of a new
fir-faggot.&nbsp; Ah, Reinecke! fallen is thy conceit, and fallen
thy tail therewith.&nbsp; Thou hast worse foes to deal with than
Bruin the bear, or Isegrim the wolf, or any foolish brute whom
thy great ancestor outwitted.&nbsp; Man the many-counselled has
been beforehand with thee; and the earths are stopped.</p>
<p>One moment he sits down to meditate, and scratches those
trusty counsellors, his ears, as if he would tear them off,
&lsquo;revolving swift thoughts in a crafty mind.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He has settled it now.&nbsp; He is up and off&mdash;and at
what a pace!&nbsp; Out of the way, Fauns and Hamadryads, if any
be left in the forest.&nbsp; What a pace!&nbsp; And with what a
grace beside!</p>
<p>Oh Reinecke, beautiful thou art, of a surety, in spite of thy
great naughtiness.&nbsp; Art thou some fallen spirit, doomed to
be hunted for thy sins in this life, and in some future life
rewarded for thy swiftness, and grace, and cunning, by being made
a very messenger of the immortals?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Not
I.</p>
<p>I am rising fast to Pistol&rsquo;s vein.&nbsp; Shall I
ejaculate?&nbsp; Shall I notify?&nbsp; Shall I waken the
echoes?&nbsp; Shall I break the grand silence by that scream
which the vulgar view-halloo call?</p>
<p>It is needless; for louder and louder every moment swells up a
sound which makes my heart leap into my mouth, and my mare into
the air.</p>
<p>Music?&nbsp; Well-beloved soul of Hullah, would that thou wert
here this day, and not in St. Martin&rsquo;s Hall, to hear that
chorus, as it pours round the fir-stems, rings against the roof
above, shatters up into a hundred echoes, till the air is live
with sound!&nbsp; You love madrigals, and whatever Weekes, or
Wilbye, or Orlando Gibbons sang of old.&nbsp; So do I.&nbsp;
Theirs is music fit for men: worthy of the age of heroes, of
Drake and Raleigh, Spenser and Shakspeare: but oh that you could
hear this madrigal!&nbsp; If you must have &lsquo;four
parts,&rsquo; then there they are.&nbsp; Deeped-mouthed bass,
rolling along the ground; rich joyful tenor; wild wistful alto;
and leaping up here and there above the throng of sounds,
delicate treble shrieks and trills of trembling joy.&nbsp; I know
not whether you can fit it into your laws of music, any more than
you can the song of that Ariel sprite who dwells in the Eolian
harp, or the roar of the waves on the rock, or</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the
lawn,<br />
And murmur of innumerable bees.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But music it is.&nbsp; A madrigal?&nbsp; Rather a whole opera
of Der Freischutz&mdash;d&aelig;moniac element and all&mdash;to
judge by those red lips, fierce eyes, wild, hungry voices; and
such as should make Reinecke, had he strong &aelig;sthetic
sympathies, well content to be hunted from his cradle to his
grave, that such sweet sounds might by him enrich the air.&nbsp;
Heroes of old were glad to die, if but some &lsquo;vates
sacer&rsquo; would sing their fame in worthy strains: and shalt
not thou too be glad, Reinecke?&nbsp; Content thyself with thy
fate.&nbsp; Music soothes care; let it soothe thine, as thou
runnest for thy life; thou shalt have enough of it in the next
hour.&nbsp; For as the Etruscans (says Athen&aelig;us) were so
luxurious that they used to flog their slaves to the sound of the
flute, so shall luxurious Chanter and Challenger, Sweet-lips and
Melody, eat thee to the sound of rich organ-pipes, that so thou
mayest,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Like that old
fabled swan, in music die.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now appear, dim at first and distant, but brightening and
nearing fast, many a right good fellow and many a right good
horse.&nbsp; I know three out of four of them, their private
histories, the private histories of their horses: and could tell
you many a good story of them: but shall not, being an English
gentleman, and not an American litt&eacute;rateur.&nbsp; They may
not all be very clever, or very learned, or very anything except
gallant men; but they are all good enough company for me, or
anyone; and each has his own specialit&eacute;, for which I like
him.&nbsp; That huntsman I have known for fifteen years, and sat
many an hour beside his father&rsquo;s death-bed.&nbsp; I am
godfather to that whip&rsquo;s child.&nbsp; I have seen the
servants of the hunt, as I have the hounds, grow up round me for
two generations, and I feel for them as old friends; and like to
look into their brave, honest, weather-beaten faces.&nbsp; That
red coat there, I knew him when he was a schoolboy; and now he is
a captain in the Guards, and won his Victoria Cross at Inkermann:
that bright green coat is the best farmer, as well as the hardest
rider, for many a mile round; one who plays, as he works, with
all his might, and might have been a beau sabreur and colonel of
dragoons.&nbsp; So might that black coat, who now brews good
beer, and stands up for the poor at the Board of Guardians, and
rides, like the green coat, as well as he works.&nbsp; That other
black coat is a county banker; but he knows more of the fox than
the fox knows of himself, and where the hounds are, there will he
be this day.&nbsp; That red coat has hunted kangaroo in
Australia: that one, as clever and good as he is brave and
simple, has stood by Napier&rsquo;s side in many an Indian fight:
that one won his Victoria at Delhi, and was cut up at Lucknow,
with more than twenty wounds: that one has&mdash;but what matter
to you who each man is?&nbsp; Enough that each can tell one a
good story, welcome one cheerfully, and give one out here, in the
wild forest, the wholesome feeling of being at home among
friends.</p>
<p>There is music, again, if you will listen, in the soft tread
of these hundred horse-hoofs upon the spongy vegetable
soil.&nbsp; They are trotting now in &lsquo;common
time.&rsquo;&nbsp; You may hear the whole Croats&rsquo; March
(the finest trotting march in the world) played by those iron
heels; the time, as it does in the Croats&rsquo; March, breaking
now and then, plunging, jingling, struggling through heavy
ground, bursting for a moment into a jubilant canter as it
reaches a sound spot.</p>
<p>The hounds feather a moment round Malepartus, puzzled by the
windings of Reinecke&rsquo;s footsteps.&nbsp; You can hear the
flap and snort of the dogs&rsquo; nostrils as they canter round;
and one likes it.&nbsp; It is exciting: but why&mdash;who can
tell?</p>
<p>What beautiful creatures they are, too!&nbsp; Next to a Greek
statue (I mean a real old Greek one; for I am a thoroughly
anti-preraphaelite benighted pagan heathen in taste, and intend
some day to get up a Cinque-Cento Club, for the total abolition
of Gothic art)&mdash;next to a Greek statue, I say, I know few
such combinations of grace and strength as in a fine
foxhound.&nbsp; It is the beauty of the Theseus&mdash;light and
yet massive; and light not in spite of its masses, but on account
of the perfect disposition of them.&nbsp; I do not care for grace
in man, woman, or animal, which is obtained (as in the old German
painters) at the expense of honest flesh and blood.&nbsp; It may
be all very pure, and unearthly, and saintly, and what not; but
it is not healthy; and, therefore, it is not really High Art, let
it call itself such as much as it likes.&nbsp; The highest art
must be that in which the outward is the most perfect symbol of
the muward; and, therefore, a healthy soul can be only exprest by
a healthy body; and starved limbs and a hydrocephalous forehead
must be either taken as incorrect symbols of spiritual
excellence, or as&mdash;what they were really meant
for&mdash;symbols of certain spiritual diseases which were in the
Middle Age considered as ecclesiastical graces and virtues.&nbsp;
Wherefore I like pagan and naturalist art; consider Titian and
Correggio as unappreciated geniuses, whose excellences the world
will in some saner mood rediscover; hold, in direct opposition to
Rio, that Rafaelle improved steadily all his life through, and
that his noblest works are not his somewhat simpering Madonnas
and somewhat impish Bambinos (very lovely though they are), but
his great, coarse, naturalist, Protestant cartoons, which (with
Andrea Mantegna&rsquo;s Heathen Triumph) Cromwell saved for the
British nation.&nbsp; Probably no one will agree with all this
for the next quarter of a century: but after that I have
hopes.&nbsp; The world will grow tired of pretending to admire
Manich&aelig;an pictures in an age of natural science; and Art
will let the dead bury their dead, and beginning again where
Michael Angelo and Rafaelle left off work forward into a nobler,
truer, freer, and more divine school than the world has yet
seen&mdash;at least, so I hope.</p>
<p>And all this has grown out of those foxhounds.&nbsp; Why
not?&nbsp; Theirs is the sort of form which expresses to me what
I want Art to express&mdash;Nature not limited, but developed, by
high civilization.&nbsp; The old savage ideal of beauty was the
lion, type of mere massive force.&nbsp; That was succeeded by an
over-civilized ideal, say the fawn, type of delicate grace.&nbsp;
By cunning breeding and choosing, through long centuries, man has
combined both, and has created the foxhound, lion and fawn in
one; just as he might create noble human beings; did he take half
as much trouble about politics (in the true old sense of the
word) as he does about fowls.&nbsp; Look at that old hound, who
stands doubtful, looking up at his master for advice.&nbsp; Look
at the severity, delicacy, lightness of every curve.&nbsp; His
head is finer than a deer&rsquo;s; his hind legs tense as steel
springs; his fore-legs straight as arrows: and yet see the depth
of chest, the sweep of loin, the breadth of paw, the mass of arm
and thigh; and if you have an eye for form, look at the absolute
majesty of his attitude at this moment.&nbsp; Majesty is the only
word for it.&nbsp; If he were six feet high, instead of
twenty-three inches, with what animal on earth could you compare
him?&nbsp; Is it not a joy to see such a thing alive?&nbsp; It is
to me, at least.&nbsp; I should like to have one in my study all
day long, as I would have a statue or a picture; and when Mr.
Morrell gave (as they say) two hundred guineas for Hercules
alone, I believe the dog was well worth the money, only to look
at.&nbsp; But I am a minute philosopher.</p>
<p>I cap them on to the spot at which Reinecke disappeared.&nbsp;
Old Virginal&rsquo;s stern flourishes; instantly her pace
quickens.&nbsp; One whimper, and she is away full-mouthed through
the wood, and the pack after her: but not I.</p>
<p>I am not going with them.&nbsp; My hunting days are
over.&nbsp; Let it suffice that I have, in the days of my vanity,
&lsquo;drank delight of battle with my peers, far on the ringing
plains&rsquo; of many a county, grass and forest, down and
vale.&nbsp; No, my gallant friends.&nbsp; You know that I could
ride, if I chose; and I am vain enough to be glad that you know
it.&nbsp; But useless are your coaxings, solicitations, wavings
of honest right hands.&nbsp; &lsquo;Life,&rsquo; as my friend Tom
Brown says, &lsquo;is not all beer and skittles;&rsquo; it is
past two now, and I have four old women to read to at three, and
an old man to bury at four; and I think, on the whole, that you
will respect me the more for going home and doing my duty.&nbsp;
That I should like to see this fox fairly killed, or even fairly
lost, I deny not.&nbsp; That I should like it as much as I can
like any earthly and outward thing, I deny not.&nbsp; But sugar
to one&rsquo;s bread and butter is not good; and if my
winter-garden represent the bread and butter, then will
fox-hunting stand to it in the relation of superfluous and
unwholesome sugar: so farewell; and long may your noble sport
prosper&mdash;&lsquo;the image of war with only half its
danger,&rsquo; to train you and your sons after, into gallant
soldiers&mdash;full of</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The reason firm, the temperate will,<br />
Endurance, foresight, strength and skill.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So homeward I go through a labyrinth of fir-stems and, what is
worse, fir-stumps, which need both my eyes and my horse&rsquo;s
at every moment; and woe to the &lsquo;anchorite,&rsquo; as old
Bunbury names him, who carries his nose in the air, and his fore
feet well under him.&nbsp; Woe to the self-willed or hard-hided
horse who cannot take the slightest hint of the heel, and wince
hind legs or fore out of the way of those jagged points which lie
in wait for him.&nbsp; Woe, in fact, to all who are clumsy or
cowardly, or in anywise not &lsquo;masters of the
situation.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Pleasant riding it is, though, if you dare look anywhere but
over your horse&rsquo;s nose, under the dark roof between the red
fir-pillars, in that rich subdued light.&nbsp; Now I plunge into
a gloomy dell, wherein is no tinkling rivulet, ever pure; but
instead a bog, hewn out into a chess-board of squares, parted by
deep narrow ditches some twenty feet apart.&nbsp; Blundering
among the stems I go, fetlock-deep in peat, and jumping at every
third stride one of the said uncanny gripes, half hidden in long
hassock grass.&nbsp; Oh <i>Aira c&aelig;spitosa</i>, most stately
and most variable of British grasses, why will you always grow
where you are not wanted?&nbsp; Through you the mare all but left
her hind legs in that last gripe.&nbsp; Through you a red-coat
ahead of me, avoiding one of your hassocks, jumped with his
horse&rsquo;s nose full butt against a fir-stem, and stopped,</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As one that is struck dead<br />
By lightning, ere he falls,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>as we shall soon, in spite of the mare&rsquo;s
cleverness.&nbsp; Would we were out of this!</p>
<p>Out of it we shall be soon.&nbsp; I see daylight ahead at
last, bright between the dark stems.&nbsp; Up a steep slope, and
over a bank which is not very big, but being composed of loose
gravel and peat mould, gives down with me, nearly sending me head
over heels in the heather, and leaving me a sheer gap to scramble
through, and out on the open moor.</p>
<p>Grand old moor! stretching your brown flats right away toward
Windsor for many a mile.&mdash;Far to our right is the new
Wellington College, looking stately enough here all alone in the
wilderness, in spite of its two ugly towers and pinched
waist.&nbsp; Close over me is the long fir-fringed ride of
Easthampstead, ending suddenly in C&aelig;sar&rsquo;s camp; and
hounds and huntsmen are already far ahead, and racing up the
Roman road, which the clods of these parts, unable to give a
better account of it, call the Devil&rsquo;s Highway.</p>
<p>Racing indeed; for as Reinecke gallops up the narrow
heather-fringed pathway, he brushes off his scent upon the twigs
at every stride; and the hounds race after him, showing no head
indeed, and keeping, for convenience, in one long line upon the
track: but going heads up, sterns down, at a pace which no horse
can follow.&mdash;I only hope they may not overrun the scent.</p>
<p>They have overrun it; halt, and put their heads down a
moment.&nbsp; But with one swift cast in fall gallop they have
hit it off again, fifty yards away in the heather, long ere the
horsemen are up to them; for those hounds can hunt a fox because
they are not hunted themselves, and so have learnt to trust
themselves, and act for themselves; as boys should learn at
school, even at the risk of a mistake or two.&nbsp; Now they are
showing head indeed, down a half-cleared valley, and over a few
ineffectual turnips withering in the peat, a patch of growing
civilization in the heart of the wilderness; and then over the
brook, while I turn slowly away, through a green wilderness of
self-sown firs.</p>
<p>There they stand in thousands, the sturdy Scots, colonizing
the desert in spite of frost, and gales, and barrenness; and
clustering together, too, as Scotsmen always do abroad, little
and big, every one under his neighbour&rsquo;s lee, according to
the good old proverb of their native land, &lsquo;Caw me, and
I&rsquo;ll caw thee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I respect them, those Scotch firs.&nbsp; I delight in their
forms, from James the First&rsquo;s gnarled giants up in
Bramshill Park&mdash;the only place in England where a painter
can learn what Scotch firs are&mdash;down to the little green
pyramids which stand up out of the heather, triumphant over
tyranny, and the strange woes of an untoward youth.&nbsp; Seven
years on an average have most of them spent in ineffectual
efforts to become a foot high.&nbsp; Nibbled off by hares,
trodden down by cattle, cut down by turf-parers, seeing hundreds
of their brethren cut up and carried off in the turf-fuel, they
are as gnarled and stubbed near the ground as an old thorn-bush
in a pasture.&nbsp; But they have conquered at last, and are
growing away, eighteen inches a year, with fair green brushes
silvertipt, reclothing the wilderness with a vegetation which it
has not seen for&mdash;how many thousand years?</p>
<p>No man can tell.&nbsp; For when last the Scotch fir was
indigenous to England, and, mixed with the larch, stretched in
one vast forest from Norfolk into Wales, England was not as it is
now.&nbsp; Snowdon was, it may be, fifteen thousand feet in
height, and from the edges of its glaciers the marmot and the
musk ox, the elk and the bear, wandered down into the Lowlands,
and the hyena and the lion dwelt in those caves where fox and
badger only now abide.&nbsp; And how did the Scotch fir die
out?&nbsp; Did the whole land sink slowly from its sub-Alpine
elevation into a warmer climate below?&nbsp; Or was it never
raised at all?&nbsp; Did some change of the Atlantic sea-floor
turn for the first time the warm Gulf Stream to these shores; and
with its soft sea-breezes melt away the &lsquo;Age of Ice,&rsquo;
till glaciers and pines, marmots and musk oxen, perspired to
death, and vanished for an &aelig;on?&nbsp; Who knows?&nbsp; Not
I.&nbsp; But of the fact there can be no doubt.&nbsp; Whether, as
we hold traditionally here, the Scotch fir was re-introduced by
James the First when he built Bramshill for Raleigh&rsquo;s
hapless pet, Henry the Prince, or whatever may have been the date
of their re-introduction, here they are, and no one can turn them
out.&nbsp; In countless thousands the winged seeds float down the
south-west gales from the older trees; and every seed which falls
takes root in ground which, however unable to bear broad-leaved
trees, is ready by long rest for the seeds of the needle-leaved
ones.&nbsp; Thousands perish yearly; but the eastward march of
the whole, up hill and down dale, is sure and steady as that of
Lynceus&rsquo; Goths in Goethe&rsquo;s Helena:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Ein lang und breites Volkegewicht,<br />
Der erate wusste vom letzen nicht.</p>
<p>Der erste fiel, der zweite stand,<br />
Des dritten Lanze war zur Hand,<br />
Ein jeder hundertfach gest&auml;rkt;<br />
Erschlagene Tausend unbemerkt&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&mdash;till, as you stand upon some eminence, you see,
stretching to the eastward of each tract of older trees, a long
cloud of younger ones, like a green comet&rsquo;s tail&mdash;I
wish their substance was as yielding this day.&nbsp; Truly
beautiful&mdash;grand indeed to me it is&mdash;to see young live
Nature thus carrying on a great savage process in the heart of
this old and seemingly all-artificial English land; and
reproducing here, as surely as in the Australian bush, a native
forest, careless of mankind.&nbsp; Still, I wish it were easier
to ride through.&nbsp; Stiff are those Scotchmen, and close and
stout they stand by each other, and claw at you as you twist
through them, the biggest aiming at your head, or even worse, at
your knees; while the middle-sized slip their brushes between
your thigh and the saddle, and the little babies tickle your
horse&rsquo;s stomach, or twine about his fore-feet.&nbsp;
Whish&mdash;whish; we are enveloped in what seems an atmosphere
of scrubbing-brushes.&nbsp; Fain would I shut my eyes: but dare
not, or I shall ride against a tree.&nbsp; Whish&mdash;whish;
alas for the horse which cannot wind and turn like a hare!&nbsp;
Plunge&mdash;stagger.&nbsp; What is this?&nbsp; A broad line of
ruts; perhaps some Celtic track-way, two thousand years old, now
matted over with firs; dangerous enough out on the open moor,
when only masked by a line of higher and darker heath: but doubly
dangerous now when masked by dark undergrowth.&nbsp; You must
find your own way here, mare.&nbsp; I will positively have
nothing to do with it.&nbsp; I disclaim all responsibility.&nbsp;
There are the reins on your neck; do what you will, only do
something&mdash;and if you can, get forward, and not back.</p>
<p>There is daylight at last, and fresh air.&nbsp; I trot
contemptuously through the advanced skirmishers of the Scotch
invading army; and watch my friends some mile and a half off, who
have threaded a practicable track-way through a long dreary
yellow bog, too wet for firs to root in, and are away in &lsquo;a
streamer.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now a streamer is produced in this
wise.&nbsp; There is but one possible gap in a bank, one possible
ford in a brook; one possible path in a cover; and as each man
has to wait till the man before him gets through, and them
gallops on, each man loses twenty yards or more on the man before
him: wherefore, by all laws of known arithmetic, if ten men tail
through a gap, then will the last of the ten find himself two
hundred yards behind the foremost, which process several times
repeated, produces the phenomenon called a streamer, viz. twenty
men galloping absurdly as hard as they can, in a line half a mile
long, and in humours which are celestial in the few foremost,
contented in the central, and gradually becoming darker in the
hindmost; till in the last man they assume a hue altogether
Tartarean.&nbsp; Farewell, brave gentlemen!&nbsp; I watch, half
sadly, half self-contented, the red coats scattered like sparks
of fire over hill and dale, and turn slowly homeward, to visit my
old women.</p>
<p>I pass through a gateway, out upon a village green, planted
with rows of oaks, surrounded by trim sunny cottages, a pleasant
oasis in the middle of the wilderness.&nbsp; Across the village
cricket-ground&mdash;we are great cricketers in these parts, and
long may the good old game live among us; and then up another
hollow lane, which leads between damp shaughs and copses toward
the further moor.</p>
<p>Curious things to a minute philosopher are these same hollow
lanes.&nbsp; They set him on arch&aelig;ological questions, more
than he can solve; and I meditate as I go, how many centuries it
took to saw through the warm sandbanks this dyke ten feet deep,
up which he trots, with the oak boughs meeting over his
head.&nbsp; Was it ever worth men&rsquo;s while to dig out the
soil?&nbsp; Surely not.&nbsp; The old method must have been, to
remove the softer upper spit, till they got to tolerably hard
ground; and then, Macadam&rsquo;s metal being as yet unknown, the
rains and the wheels of generations sawed it gradually deeper and
deeper, till this road-ditch was formed.&nbsp; But it must have
taken centuries to do it.&nbsp; Many of these hollow lanes,
especially those on flat ground, must be as old or older than the
Conquest.&nbsp; In Devonshire I am sure that they are.&nbsp; But
there many of them, one suspects, were made not of malice, but of
cowardice prepense.&nbsp; Your indigenous Celt was, one fears, a
sneaking animal, and liked to keep when he could under cover of
banks and hill-sides; while your bold Roman made his raised roads
straight over hill and dale, as &lsquo;ridge-ways&rsquo; from
which, as from an eagle&rsquo;s eyrie, he could survey the
conquered lowlands far and wide.&nbsp; It marks strongly the
difference between the two races, that difference between the
Roman paved road with its established common way for all
passengers, its regular stations and milestones, and the Celtic
track-way winding irresolutely along in innumerable ruts, parting
to meet again, as if each savage (for they were little better)
had taken his own fresh path when he found the next line of ruts
too heavy for his cattle.&nbsp; Around the spurs of Dartmoor I
have seen many ancient roads, some of them long disused, which
could have been hollowed out for no other purpose but that of
concealment.</p>
<p>So I go slowly up the hill, till the valley lies beneath me
like a long green garden between its two banks of brown moor; and
on through a cheerful little green, with red brick cottages
scattered all round, each with its large neat garden, and
beehives, and pigs and geese, and turf-stack, and clipt yews and
hollies before the door, and rosy dark-eyed children, and all the
simple healthy comforts of a wild
&lsquo;heth-cropper&rsquo;s&rsquo; home.&nbsp; When he can, the
good man of the house works at farm labour, or cuts his own turf;
and when work is scarce, he cuts copses and makes heath-brooms,
and does a little poaching.&nbsp; True, he seldom goes to church,
save to be christened, married, or buried: but he equally seldom
gets drunk.&nbsp; For church and public stand together two miles
off; so that social wants sometimes bring their own compensations
with them, and there are two sides to every question.</p>
<p>Hark!&nbsp; A faint, dreary hollo off the moor above.&nbsp;
And then another, and another.&nbsp; My friends may trust it; for
the clod of these parts delights in the chase like any
bare-legged Paddy, and casts away flail and fork wildly, to run,
shout, assist, and interfere in all possible ways, out of pure
love.&nbsp; The descendant of many generations of broom-squires
and deer-stealers, the instinct of sport is strong within him
still, though no more of the king&rsquo;s deer are to be shot in
the winter turnip-fields, or worse, caught by an apple-baited
hook hung from an orchard bough.&nbsp; He now limits his
aspirations to hares and pheasants, and too probably once in his
life, &lsquo;hits the keeper into the river,&rsquo; and
reconsiders himself for a while after over a crank in Winchester
gaol.&nbsp; Well, he has his faults; and I have mine.&nbsp; But
he is a thorough good fellow nevertheless; quite as good as I:
civil, contented, industrious, and often very handsome; and a far
shrewder fellow too&mdash;owing to his dash of wild forest blood,
from gipsy, highwayman; and what not&mdash;than his bullet-headed
and flaxen-polled cousin, the pure South-Saxon of the
Chalk-downs.&nbsp; Dark-haired he is, ruddy, and tall of bone;
swaggering in his youth; but when he grows old, a thorough
gentleman, reserved, stately, and courteous as a prince.&nbsp;
Sixteen years have I lived with him hail fellow well met, and
never yet had a rude word or action from him.</p>
<p>With him I have cast in my lot, to live and die, and be buried
by his side; and to him I go home contented, to look after his
petty interests, cares, sorrows&mdash;Petty, truly&mdash;seeing
that they include the whole primal mysteries of life&mdash;Food,
raiment, and work to earn them withal; love and marriage, birth
and death, right doing and wrong doing, &lsquo;Schicksal und
eigene Schuld;&rsquo; and all those commonplaces of humanity
which in the eyes of a minute philosopher are most divine,
because they are most commonplace&mdash;catholic as the sunshine
and the rain which come down from the Heavenly Father, alike upon
the evil and the good.&nbsp; As for doing fine things, my friend,
with you, I have learnt to believe that I am not set to do fine
things, simply because I am not able to do them; and as for
seeing fine things, with you, I have learnt to see the
sight&mdash;as well as to try to do the duty&mdash;which lies
nearest me; and to comfort myself with the fancy that if I make
good use of my eyes and brain in this life, I shall see&mdash;if
it be of any use to me&mdash;all the fine things, or perhaps
finer still, in the life to come.&nbsp; But if not&mdash;what
matter?&nbsp; In any life, in any state, however simple or
humble, there will be always sufficient to occupy a Minute
Philosopher; and if a man be busy, and busy about his duty, what
more does he require, for time or for eternity?</p>

<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span><i>FROM
OCEAN TO SEA</i>.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> point from which to start, in
order best to appreciate the change from ocean to sea, is perhaps
Biarritz.&nbsp; The point at which to stop is Cette.&nbsp; And
the change is important.&nbsp; Between the two points races are
changed, climates are changed, scenery is changed, the very
plants under your feet are changed, from a Western to an Eastern
type.&nbsp; You pass from the wild Atlantic into the heart of the
Roman Empire&mdash;from the influences which formed the
discoverers of the New World, to those which formed the
civilizers of the Old.&nbsp; Gascony, not only in its scenery,
but in its very legends, reminds you of Devon and Cornwall;
Languedoc of Greece and Palestine.</p>
<p>In the sea, as was to be expected, the change is even more
complete.&nbsp; From Biarritz to Cette, you pass from poor Edward
Forbes&rsquo;s Atlantic to his Mediterranean centre of
creation.&nbsp; In plain English and fact, whether you agree with
his theory or not, you pass from the region of respectable
whales, herrings, and salmon, to that of tunnies, sci&aelig;nas,
dorados, and all the gorgons, hydras, and chim&aelig;ras dire,
which are said to grace the fish-markets of Barcelona or
Marseilles.</p>
<p>But to this assertion, as to most concerning nature, there are
exceptions.&nbsp; Mediterranean fishes slip out of the Straits of
Gibraltar, and up the coast of Portugal, and, once in the Bay of
Biscay, find the feeding good and the wind against them, and stay
there.</p>
<p>So it befalls, that at worthy M. Gard&egrave;re&rsquo;s hotel
at Biarritz (he has seen service in England, and knows our
English ways), you may have at dinner, day after day, salmon,
louvine, shad, sardine, dorado, tunny.&nbsp; The first is unknown
to the Mediterranean; for Fluellen mistook when he said that
there were salmons in Macedon, as well as Monmouth; the louvine
is none other than the nasty bass, or sea-perch of the Atlantic;
the shad (extinct in these islands, save in the Severn) is a
gigantic herring which comes up rivers to spawn; a fish common
(with slight differences) to both sides of the North Atlantic;
while the sardine, the dorado, and the tunny (whether he be the
true tunny or the Alalonga) are Mediterranean fish.</p>
<p>The whale fishery of these shores is long extinct.&nbsp; The
Biscayan whale was supposed to be extinct likewise.&nbsp; But
like the ibex, and some other animals which man has ceased to
hunt, because he fancies that he has killed them all, they seem
inclined to reappear.&nbsp; For in 1854 one was washed ashore
near St. Jean de Luz, at news whereof Eschricht, the great Danish
naturalist, travelled night and day from Copenhagen, and secured
the skeleton of the new-old monster.</p>
<p>But during the latter part of the Middle Ages, and on&mdash;if
I recollect aright&mdash;into the seventeenth century, Bayonne,
Biarritz, Guettary, and St. Jean de Luz, sent forth their hardy
whale-fishers, who slew all the whales of the Biscayan seas, and
then crossed the Atlantic, to attack those of the frozen
North.</p>
<p>British and American enterprise drove them from the West coast
of the Atlantic; and now their descendants are content to stay at
home and take the sardine-shoals, and send them in to Bayonne on
their daughters&rsquo; heads.</p>
<p>Pretty enough it was, at least in outward seeming, to meet a
party of those fisher-girls, bare-legged, high-kilted, lithe as
deer, trotting, at a long loping pace, up the high road toward
Bayonne, each with her basket on her head, as she laughed and
sang, and tossed her black hair, and flashed her brown eyes, full
of life and the enjoyment of life.&nbsp; Pretty enough.&nbsp; And
yet who will blame the rail, which now sends her quickly into
Bayonne&mdash;or even her fish without her; and relieves the fair
young maiden from being degraded into a beast of burden?</p>
<p>Handsome folk are these brown Basques.&nbsp; A mysterious
people, who dwell alone, and are not counted among the nations;
speaking an unique language, and keeping up unique customs, for
which the curious must consult M. Michel&rsquo;s interesting
book.&nbsp; There may be a cross of English blood among them,
too, about Biarritz and Bayonne; English features there are,
plainly to be seen.&nbsp; And whether or not, one accepts the
story of the country, that Anglets, near by, is an old English
colony left by our Black Prince, it is certain that Bayonne
Cathedral was built in part by English architects, and carries
the royal arms of England; and every school history will tell us
how this corner of France was long in our hands, and was indeed
English long before it was properly French.&nbsp; Moorish blood
there may be, too, here and there, left behind by those who built
the little &lsquo;atalaya&rsquo; or fire-beacon, over the old
harbour, to correspond, by its smoke column, with a long line of
similar beacons down the Spanish coast.&nbsp; The Basques
resemble in look the Southern Welsh&mdash;quick-eyed, neat in
feature, neat in dress, often, both men and women,
beautiful.&nbsp; The men wear a flat Scotch cap of some bright
colour, and call it &lsquo;berretta.&rsquo;&nbsp; The women tie a
gaudy handkerchief round their heads, and compel one corner to
stand forward from behind the ear in a triangle, in proportion to
the size and stiffness whereof the lady seems to think herself
well dressed.&nbsp; But the pretty Basque handkerchief will soon
give place to the Parisian bonnet.&nbsp; For every cove among the
rocks is now filled with smart bathing-houses, from which, in
summer, the gay folk of Paris issue in &lsquo;costume de
bain,&rsquo; to float about all day on calabashes&mdash;having
literally no room for the soles of their feet on land.&nbsp; Then
are opened casinos, theatre, shops, which lie closed all the
winter.&nbsp; Then do the Basque house-owners flee into the
moors, and camp out (it is said) on the hills all night, letting
their rooms for ten francs a night as mere bed-chambers&mdash;for
all eating and living is performed in public; while the
dove-coloured oxen, with brown holland pinafores over their
backs, who dawdle in pairs up and down the long street with their
light carts, have to make way for wondrous equipages from the
Bois de Boulogne.</p>
<p>Not then, for the wise man, is Biarritz a place to see and to
love: but in the winter, when a little knot of quiet pleasant
English hold the place against all comers, and wander,
undisturbed by fashion, about the quaint little rocks and caves
and natural bridges&mdash;and watch tumbling into the sea, before
the Biscayan surges, the trim walks and summer-houses, which were
erected by the municipality in honour of the Empress and her
suite.&nbsp; Yearly they tumble in, and yearly are renewed, as
the soft greensand strata are graven away, and what must have
been once a long promontory becomes a group of fantastic pierced
rocks, exactly like those which are immortalized upon the
willow-pattern plates.</p>
<p>Owing to this rapid destruction, the rocks of Biarritz are
very barren in sea-beasts and sea-weeds.&nbsp; But there is one
remarkable exception, where the pools worn in a hard limestone
are filled with what seem at first sight beds of china-asters, of
all loveliest colours&mdash;primrose, sea-green, dove, purple,
crimson, pink, ash-grey.&nbsp; They are all prickly sea-eggs
(presumably the <i>Echinus lividus</i>, which is found in similar
places in the west of Ireland), each buried for life in a
cup-shaped hole which he has excavated in the rock, and shut in
by an overhanging lip of living lime&mdash;seemingly a Nullipore
coralline.&nbsp; What they do there, what they think of, or what
food is brought into their curious grinding-mills by the Atlantic
surges which thunder over them twice a day, who can tell?&nbsp;
However they form, without doubt, the most beautiful object which
I have ever seen in pool or cove.</p>
<p>But the glory of Biarritz, after all, is the moors above, and
the view to be seen therefrom.&nbsp; Under blazing blue skies,
tempered by soft dappled cloud, for ever sliding from the
Atlantic and the Asturias mountains, in a climate soft as milk,
and exhilarating withal as wine, one sees far and wide a panorama
which, from its variety as well as its beauty, can never
weary.</p>
<p>To the north, the long sand-line of the Biscayan
shore&mdash;the bar of the Adour marked by a cloud of grey
spray.&nbsp; Then the dark pine-flats of the Landes, and the
towers of Bayonne rising through rich woods.&nbsp; To the
eastward lies a high country, furred with woods, broken with
glens; a country exactly like Devon, through the heart of which,
hidden in such a gorge as that of Dart or Taw, runs the swift
stream of the Nive, draining the western Pyrenees.&nbsp; And
beyond, to the south-east, in early spring, the Pyrenean snows
gleam bright, white clouds above the clouds.&nbsp; As one turns
southward, the mountains break down into brown heather-hills,
like Scottish grouse moors.&nbsp; The two nearest, and seemingly
highest, are the famous Rhune and Bayonette, where lie, to this
day, amid the heath and crags, hundreds of unburied bones.&nbsp;
For those great hills, skilfully fortified by Soult before the
passage of the Bidassoa, were stormed, yard by yard, by
Wellington&rsquo;s army in October 1813.&nbsp; That mighty deed
must be read in the pages of one who saw it with his own eyes,
and fought there with his own noble body, and even nobler
spirit.&nbsp; It is not for me to tell of victories, of which Sir
William Napier has already told.</p>
<p>Towards that hill, and the Nivelle at its foot, the land
slopes down, still wooded and broken, bounded by a long sweep of
clayey crumbling cliff.&nbsp; The eye catches the fort of Secoa,
at the mouth of the Nivelle&mdash;once Wellington&rsquo;s
sea-base for his great French campaign.&nbsp; Then Fontarabia, at
the Bidassoa mouth; and far off, the cove within which lies the
fatal citadel of St. Sebastian; all backed up by the fantastic
mountains of Spain; the four-horned &ldquo;Quatre
Couronnes,&rdquo; the pyramidal Jaysquivel, and beyond them
again, sloping headlong into the sea, peak after peak, each one
more blue and tender than the one before, leading the eye on and
on for seemingly countless leagues, till they die away into the
ocean horizon and the boundless west.&nbsp; Not a sail, often for
days together, passes between those mountains and the shore on
which we stand, to break the solitude, and peace, and vast
expanse; and we linger, looking and looking at we know not what,
and find repose in gazing purposeless into the utter void.</p>
<p>Very unlike France are these Basque uplands; very like the
seaward parts of Devon and Cornwall.&nbsp; Large oak-copses and
boggy meadows fill the glens; while above, the small fields, with
their five-barred gates (relics of the English occupation) and
high furze and heath-grown banks, make you fancy yourself for a
moment in England.&nbsp; And the illusion is strengthened, as you
see that the heath of the banks is the Goonhilly heath of the
Lizard Point, and that of the bogs the orange-belled <i>Erica
ciliaris</i>, which lingers (though rare) both in Cornwall and in
the south of Ireland.&nbsp; But another glance undeceives
you.&nbsp; The wild flowers are new, saving those cosmopolitan
seeds (like nettles and poppies) which the Romans have carried
all over Europe, and the British are now carrying over the
world.&nbsp; Every sandy bank near the sea is covered with the
creeping stems of a huge reed, which grows in summer tall enough
to make not only high fences, but fishing-rods.&nbsp; Poverty
(though there is none of what we call poverty in Britain) fills
the little walled court before its cottage with bay trees and
standard figs; while wealth (though there is nothing here of what
we call wealth in Britain) asserts itself uniformly by great
standard magnolias, and rich trailing roses, in full bloom here
in April instead of&mdash;as with us&mdash;in July.&nbsp; Both on
bank and in bog grow Scorzoneras (dandelions with sword-shaped
leaves) of which there are none in these isles; and every common
is ablaze with strange and lovely flowers.&nbsp; Each dry spot is
brilliant with the azure flowers of a prostrate Lithospermum, so
exquisite a plant, that it is a marvel why we do not see it, as
&lsquo;spring-bedding,&rsquo; in every British garden.&nbsp; The
heath is almost hidden, in places, by the large white flowers and
trailing stems of the sage-leaved Cistus.&nbsp; Delicate purple
Ixias, and yet more delicate Hoop-petticoat Narcissus, spring
from the turf.&nbsp; And here and there among furze and heath,
crop out great pink bunches of the <i>Daphne Cneorum</i> of our
gardens, perfuming all the air.&nbsp; Yes, we are indeed in
foreign parts, in the very home of that Atlantic flora, of which
only a few species have reached the south-west of these isles;
and on the limit of another flora also&mdash;of that of Italy and
Greece.&nbsp; For as we descend into the glen, every lane-bank
and low tree is entwined, not with ivy, but with a still more
beautiful evergreen, the Smilax of South-eastern Europe, with its
zigzag stems, and curving heart-shaped leaves, and hooked thorns;
the very oak-scrub is of species unknown to Britain.&nbsp; And
what are these tall lilies, which fill every glade breast-high
with their sword-like leaves, and spires of white flowers,
lilac-pencilled?&nbsp; They are the classic flower, the Asphodel
of Greece and Grecian song; the Asphodel through which the ghosts
of Homer&rsquo;s heroes strode: as heroes&rsquo; ghosts might
stride even here.</p>
<p>For here we are on sacred ground.&nbsp; The vegetation is rank
with the blood of gallant invaders, and of no less gallant
patriots.&nbsp; In the words of Campbell&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Hohenlinden&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Every turf beneath our feet<br />
May be a hero&rsquo;s sepulchre.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That little tarn below has &lsquo;bubbled with crimson
foam&rsquo; when the kings of Europe arose to bring home the
Bourbons, as did the Lake Regillus of old, in the day when
&lsquo;the Thirty Cities swore to bring the Tarquins
home.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Turn to the left, above the tarn, and into the great Spanish
road from Bayonne to the frontier at what was lately &lsquo;La
Negresse,&rsquo; but is now a gay railway station.&nbsp; Where
that station is, was another tarn, now drained.&nbsp; The road
ran between the two.&nbsp; And that narrow space of two hundred
yards, on which we stand, was for three fearful days the gate of
France.</p>
<p>For on the 10th of December, 1813, Soult, driven into Bayonne
by Wellington&rsquo;s advance, rushed out again in the early
morn, and poured a torrent of living men down this road, and
upwards again towards the British army which crested that long
ridge in front.</p>
<p>The ridge slopes rapidly away at the back, toward the lowlands
of the Bidassoa; and once thrust from it, the English army would
have been cut in two&mdash;one half driven back upon their
sea-base at St. Jean de Luz: the other half left on the further
side of the Adour.</p>
<p>And this was the gate, which had to be defended during a three
days&rsquo; battle.&nbsp; That long copse which overhangs the
road is the famous wood, which was taken and retaken many
times.&nbsp; You house above it, embowered in trees, is the
&lsquo;Mayor&rsquo;s house,&rsquo; in which Sir John Hope was so
nearly captured by the French.&nbsp; Somewhere behind the lane
where we came down was the battery which blasted off our troops
as they ran up from the lowlands behind, to support their
fellows.</p>
<p>Of the details of the fight you must read in Napier&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Peninsular War,&rsquo; and in Mr. Gleig&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Subaltern.&rsquo;&nbsp; They are not to be described by
one who never saw a battle, great or small.</p>
<p>And now, if you choose to start upon your journey from the
ocean to the sea, you will take the railroad here, and run five
miles through the battle-fields into Bayonne, the quaint old
fortress city, girdled with a labyrinth of walls, and turf-dykes,
and outside them meadows as rich, and trees as stately, as if war
had never swept across the land.&nbsp; You may stop, if you will,
to look at the tall Spanish houses, with their piazzas and
jalousies, and the motley populace, French, Basques, Spaniards,
Jews; and, most worth seeing of all, the lovely ladies of
Bayonne, who swarm out when the sun goes down, for air and
military music.&nbsp; You may try to find (in which you will
probably fail) the arms of England in the roof of the ugly old
cathedral; you may wander the bridges over which join the three
quarters of the city (for the Adour and the Nive meet within the
walls), and probably lose your way&mdash;a slight matter among
folk who, if you will but take off your hat, call them Monsieur,
apologize for the trouble you are giving, begin the laugh at your
own stupidity, and compliment them on their city and their fair
ladies, will be delighted to walk a mile out of their own way to
show you yours.&nbsp; You will gaze up at the rock-rooted citadel
from whence, in the small hours of April 14, 1813, after peace
was agreed on, but unhappily not declared (for Napier has fully
exculpated the French Generals), three thousand of
Thouvenot&rsquo;s men burst forth against Sir John Hope&rsquo;s
unsuspecting besiegers, with a furious valour which cost the
English more than 800 men.</p>
<p>There, in the pine woods on the opposite side, is the
Boucault, where our besieging army lay.&nbsp; Across the reach
below stretched Sir John Hope&rsquo;s famous bridge; and as you
leave Bayonne by rail, you run beneath the English cemetery,
where lie the soldiers (officers of the Coldstream Guards among
them) who fell in the Frenchman&rsquo;s last struggle to defend
his native land.</p>
<p>But enough of this.&nbsp; I should not have recalled to mind
one of these battles, had they not, one and all, been as glorious
for the French and their great captain&mdash;wearied with long
marches, disheartened by the apathy of their own countrymen, and,
as they went on, overpowered by mere numbers&mdash;as they were
for our veterans, and Wellington himself.</p>
<p>And now, once through Bayonne, we are in the Pignadas and the
Landes.</p>
<p>To form a conception of these famous Landes, it is only
necessary to run down by the South-Western Railway, through the
moors of Woking or Ascot; spread them out flat, and multiply them
to seeming infinity.&nbsp; The same sea of brown heather, broken
only by the same dark pignadas, or fir plantations, extends for
nigh a hundred miles; and when the traveller northward has lost
sight, first of the Spanish mountains, and then of the Pyrenean
snows, he seems to be rushing along a brown ocean, without wave
or shore.&nbsp; Only, instead of the three heaths of Surrey and
Hants (the same species as those of Scotland), larger and richer
southern heaths cover the grey sands; and notably the delicate
upright spires of the bruy&egrave;re, or <i>Erica scoparia</i>,
which grows full six feet high, and furnishes from its roots
those &lsquo;bruy&egrave;re&rsquo; pipes, which British
shopkeepers have rechristened &lsquo;briar-roots.&rsquo;&nbsp;
Instead, again, of the Scotch firs of Ascot, the pines are all
pinasters (miscalled <i>P. maritima</i>).&nbsp; Each has the same
bent stem, carrying at top, long, ragged, scanty, leaf-tufts,
instead of the straight stem and dense short foliage of the
sturdier Scotchman; and down each stem runs a long, fresh scar,
and at the bottom (in spring at least), hangs a lip of tin, and a
neat earthen pipkin, into which distils turpentine as clear as
glass.&nbsp; The trees have mostly been planted within the last
fifty years, to keep the drifting sands from being blown
away.&nbsp; As timber they are about as valuable as those Jersey
cow-cabbage stalks, of which the curious will at times make
walking-sticks: but as producers of turpentine they have their
use, and give employment to the sad, stunted, ill-fed folk,
unhealthy for want of water, and barbarous from utter loneliness,
whose only employment, in old times, was the keeping ragged
flocks about the moors.&nbsp; Few and far between the natives may
be seen from the railway, seemingly hung high in air, till on
nearer approach you find them to be stalking along on stilts, or
standing knitting on the same, a sheepskin over their shoulders,
an umbrella strapped to their side, and, stuck into the small of
the back, a long crutch, which serves, when resting, as a third
wooden leg.</p>
<p>So run on the Landes, mile after mile, station after station,
varied only by an occasional stunted cork tree, or a starved
field of barley or maize.&nbsp; But the railroad is bringing to
them, as elsewhere, labour, civilization, agricultural
improvement.&nbsp; Pretty villages, orchards, gardens, are
springing up round the lonely &lsquo;gares.&rsquo;&nbsp; The late
Emperor helped forward, it is said, new pine plantations, and
sundry schemes for reclaiming the waste.&nbsp; Arcachon, on a
pine-fringed lagoon of the Atlantic, has great artificial ponds
for oyster breeding, and is rising into a gay watering-place,
with a distinguished scientific society.&nbsp; Nay, more: it saw
a few years since an international exposition of fish, and
fish-culture, and fishing-tackle, and all things connected with
the fisheries, not only of Europe, but of America likewise.&nbsp;
Heaven speed the plan; and restore thereby oysters to our shores,
and shad and salmon to the rivers both of Western Europe and
Eastern North America.</p>
<p>As for the cause of the Landes, it may be easily divined, by
the help of a map and of common sense.</p>
<p>The Gironde and the Adour carry to the sea the drainage of
nearly a third of France, including almost all the rain which
falls on the north side of the Pyrenees.&nbsp; What has become of
all the sand and mud which has been swept in the course of ages
down their channels?&nbsp; What has become&mdash;a very small
part, be it recollected, of the whole amount&mdash;of all the
rock which has been removed by rain and thunder, frost and snow,
in the process of scooping out the deep valleys of the
Pyrenees?&nbsp; Out of that one crack, which men call the Val
d&rsquo;Ossau, stone has been swept enough to form a considerable
island.&nbsp; Where is it all?&nbsp; In these Landes.&nbsp;
Carried down year by year to the Atlantic, it has been driven
back again, year by year, by the fierce gales of the Bay of
Biscay, and rolled up into banks and dunes of loose sand, till it
has filled up what was once a broad estuary, 140 miles across and
perhaps 70 miles in depth.&nbsp; Upheaved it may have been also,
slowly, from the sea, for recent sea-shells are found as far
inland as Dax; and thus the whole upper end of the Bay of Biscay
has transformed itself during the lapse of, it may be, countless
ages, into a desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>It is at Dax that we leave the main line, and instead of
running north for Bordeaux and the land of clarets, turn
south-east to Orthez and Pau, and the Gaves, and the
Pyrenees.</p>
<p>And now we pass through ragged uplands, woody and moorish,
with the long yellow maize-stalks of last year&rsquo;s crop
rotting in the swampy glens.&nbsp; For the &lsquo;petite
culture,&rsquo; whatever be its advantages, gives no capital or
power of combined action for draining wet lands; and the valleys
of Gascony and Bearn in the south, as well as great sheets of the
Pas de Calais in the north, are in a waterlogged state, equally
shocking to the eye of a British farmer, and injurious to the
health and to the crops of the peasants.</p>
<p>Soon we strike the Adour, here of the shape and size of a
second-class Scotch salmon-stream, with swirling brown pools
beneath grey crags, which make one long to try in them the
virtues of &lsquo;Jock Scott,&rsquo; &lsquo;the Butcher,&rsquo;
or the &lsquo;Dusty Miller.&rsquo;&nbsp; And perhaps not without
effect; for salmon are there still; and will be more and more as
French &lsquo;pisciculture&rsquo; develops itself under
Government supervision.</p>
<p>Here we touch again the line of that masterly retreat of
Soult&rsquo;s before the superior forces of Wellington, to which
Napier has done such ample and deserved justice.</p>
<p>There is Berenz, where the Sixth and Light divisions crossed
the Gave, and clambered into the high road up steep ravines; and
there is Orthez itself, with the beautiful old Gothic bridge
which the French could not blow up, as they did every other
bridge on their retreat; and the ruins of that robber den to
which Gaston Ph&oelig;bus, Count of Foix (of whom you may read in
Froissart), used to drag his victims; and there overhead, upon
the left of the rail and road, is the old Roman camp, and the
hill of Orthez, and St. Boes, and the High Church of Baights, the
scene of the terrible battle of Orthez.</p>
<p>The Roman camp, then &lsquo;open and grassy, with a few
trees,&rsquo; says Napier, is now covered with vineyards.&nbsp;
Everywhere the fatal slopes are rich with cultivation, plenty,
and peace.&nbsp; God grant they may remain so for ever.</p>
<p>And so, along the Gave de Pau, we run on to Pau, the ancient
capital of Bearn; the birthplace of Henri Quatre, and of
Bernadotte, King of Sweden; where, in the charming old
ch&acirc;teau, restored by Louis Philippe, those who list may see
the tortoise which served as the great Henry&rsquo;s cradle; and
believe, if they list also, the tale that that is the real
shell.</p>
<p>For in 1793, when the knights of the &lsquo;bonnet
rouge&rsquo; and &lsquo;carmagnole complete&rsquo; burst into the
castle, to destroy every memorial of hated royalty, the shell
among the rest, there chanced&mdash;miraculous
coincidence&mdash;to be in Pau, in the collection of a
naturalist, another shell, of the same shape and size.&nbsp;
Swiftly and deftly pious hands substituted it for the real relic,
leaving it to be battered in pieces and trampled in the mud,
while the royal cradle lay perdu for years in the roof of a
house, to reappear duly at the Restoration of the Bourbons.</p>
<p>Of Pau I shall say nothing.&nbsp; It would be real
impertinence in one who only spent three days in it, to describe
a city which is known to all Europe; which is a permanent English
colony, and boasts of one, and sometimes two, packs of English
foxhounds.&nbsp; But this I may be allowed to say.&nbsp; That of
all delectable spots I have yet seen, Pau is the most
delectable.&nbsp; Of all the landscapes which I have beheld, that
from the Place Royale is, for variety, richness, and grandeur,
the most glorious; at least as I saw it for the first time.</p>
<p>Beneath the wall of the high terrace are rich meadows, vocal
with frogs rejoicing in the rain, and expressing their joy, not
in the sober monotone of our English frogs, but each according to
his kind; one bellowing, the next barking, the next cawing, and
the next (probably the little green Hylas, who has come down out
of the trees to breed) quacking in treble like a tiny
drake.&nbsp; The bark (I suspect) is that of the gorgeous edible
frog; and so suspect the young recruits who lounge upon the wall,
and look down wistfully, longing, I presume, to eat him.&nbsp;
And quite right they are; for he (at least his thigh) is
exceeding good to eat, tenderer and sweeter than any spring
chicken.</p>
<p>Beyond the meadow, among the poplars, the broad Gave murmurs
on over shingly shallows, between aspen-fringed islets, grey with
the melting snows; and beyond her again rise broken wooded hills,
dotted with handsome houses; and beyond them a veil of mist and
rain.</p>
<p>On a sudden that veil lifts; and five-and-twenty miles away,
beneath the black edge of the cloud, against the clear blue sky,
stands out the whole snow-range of the Pyrenees; and in the
midst, exactly opposite, filling up a vast gap which is the Val
d&rsquo;Ossau, the huge cone, still snowy white, of the Pic du
Midi.</p>
<p>He who is conversant with theatres will be unable to overlook
the seeming art&mdash;and even artifice&mdash;of such an
effect.&nbsp; The clouds lift like a drop-scene; the mountains
are so utterly unlike any natural object in the north, that for
the moment one fancies them painted and not real; the Pic du Midi
stands so exactly where it ought, and is yet so fantastic and
unexpected in its shape, that an artist seems to have put it
there.</p>
<p>But lie who knows nothing, and cares less, about theatres and
their sham glories, and sees for the first time in his life the
eternal snows of which he has read since childhood, draws his
breath deeply, and stands astounded, whispering to himself that
God is great.</p>
<p>One hint more, ere we pass on from Pau.&nbsp; Here, at least
in spring time, of all places in Europe, may a man feed his ears
with song of birds.&nbsp; The copses by the Gave, the public
walks and woods (wherein English prejudices have happily
protected what is elsewhere shot down as game, even to the poor
little cock-robins whose corpses lie by dozens in too many French
markets), are filled with all our English birds of passage,
finding their way northwards from Morocco and Algiers; and with
our English nightingales, black-caps, willow-wrens, and
whitethroats, are other songsters which never find their way to
these isles, for which you must consult the pages of Mr. Gould or
Mr. Bree&mdash;and chief among them the dark Orpheus, and the
yellow Hippolais, surpassing the black-cap, and almost equalling
the nightingale, for richness and variety of song&mdash;the
polyglot warbler which penetrates, in summer, as far north as the
shores of the British Channel, and there stops short, scared by
the twenty miles of sea, after a land journey&mdash;and by night,
too, as all the warblers journey&mdash;from Africa.</p>
<p>At Pau, the railroad ended when I was there; and who would go
eastward had to take carriage, and go by the excellent road (all
public roads in the south of France are excellent, and equal to
our best English roads) over the high Landes to Tarbes; and on
again over fresh Landes to Montrejeau; and thence by railway to
Toulouse.</p>
<p>They are very dreary, these high flat uplands, from which
innumerable streams pour down to swell the Adour and the Garonne;
and as one rolls along, listening to the eternal tinkle of the
horse-bells, only two roadside objects are particularly worthy of
notice.&nbsp; First, the cultivation, spreading rapidly since the
Revolution, over what was open moor; and next the great natural
parks which one traverses here and there; the remnants of those
forests which were once sacred to the seigneurs and their field
sports.&nbsp; The seigneurs are gone now, and the game with them;
and the forests are almost gone&mdash;so ruinate, indeed, by the
peasantry, that the Government (I believe) has interfered to stop
a destruction of timber, which involves the destruction both of
fire-wood and of the annual fall of rain.&nbsp; But the trees
which remain, whether in forest or in homestead, are sadly
mangled.&nbsp; The winters are sharp in these high uplands, and
firing scarce; and the country method of obtaining it is to send
a woman up a tree, where she hacks off, with feeble arms and
feeble tools, boughs halfway out from the stem, disfiguring, and
in time destroying by letting the wet enter, splendid southern
oaks, chestnuts, and walnuts.&nbsp; Painful and hideous, to an
eye accustomed to British parks, are the forms of these once
noble trees.</p>
<p>Suddenly we descend a brow into the Yale of Tarbes: a good
land and large; a labyrinth of clear streams, water-meadows,
cherry-orchards, and crops of every kind, and in the midst the
pleasant old city, with its once famous University.&nbsp; Of
Tarbes, you may read in the pages of Froissart&mdash;or, if you
prefer a later authority, in those of Dumas, &lsquo;Trois
Mousquetaires;&rsquo; for this is the native land of the immortal
Ulysses of Gascony, the Chevalier d&rsquo;Artagnan.</p>
<p>There you may see, to your surprise, not only gentlemen, but
ladies, taking their pleasure on horseback after the English
fashion; for there is close by a great &lsquo;haras,&rsquo; or
Government establishment for horse-breeding.&nbsp; You may watch
the quaint dresses in the marketplace; you may rest, as Froissart
rested of old, in a &lsquo;right pleasant inn;&rsquo; you may eat
of the delicious cookery which is to be found, even in remote
towns, throughout the south of France, and even&mdash;if you
dare&mdash;of &lsquo;Coquilles aux Champignons.&rsquo;&nbsp; You
may sit out after dinner in that delicious climate, listening to
the rush of the clear Adour through streets, and yards, and
culverts; for the city, like Romsey, or Salisbury, is built over
many streams.&nbsp; You may watch the Pyrenees changing from
white to rose, from rose to lead colour, and then dying away into
the night&mdash;for twilight there is little or none, here in the
far south.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The sun&rsquo;s rim dips, the stars rush
out,<br />
At one stride comes the dark.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And soon from street to street you hear the
&lsquo;clarion&rsquo; of the garrison, that singularly wild and
sweet trumpet-call which sends French soldiers to their
beds.&nbsp; And at that the whole populace swarms out, rich and
poor, and listens entranced beneath the trees in the Place
Maubourguet, as if they had never heard it before; with an order
and a sobriety, and a good humour, and a bowing to each other,
and asking and giving of cigar-lights between men of every
class&mdash;and a little quiet modest love-making on the
outskirts of the crowd, which is very pleasant to behold.&nbsp;
And when the music is silent, and the people go off suddenly,
silently, and soberly withal (for there are no drunkards in these
parts), to their early beds, you stand and look up into the
&lsquo;purple night,&rsquo; as Homer calls it&mdash;that southern
sky, intensely dark, and yet transparent withal, through which
you seem to look beyond the stars into the infinite itself, and
recollect that beyond all that, and through all that likewise,
there is an infinite good God who cares for all these simple
kindly folk; and that by Him all their hearts are as well known,
and all their infirmities as mercifully weighed, as are, you
trust, your own.</p>
<p>And so you go to rest, content to say, with the wise American,
&lsquo;It takes all sorts to make a world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The next morn you rise, to roll on over yet more weary uplands
to Montrejeau, over long miles of sandy heath, a magnified
Aldershott, which during certain summer months is gay, here and
there, like Aldershott, with the tents of an army at play.&nbsp;
But in spring the desolation is utter, and the loneliest
grouse-moor, and the boggiest burn, are more cheerful and varied
than the Landes of Lannemezan, and the foul streamlets which have
sawn gorges through the sandy waste.</p>
<p>But all the while, on your right hand, league after league,
ever fading into blue sky behind you, and growing afresh out of
blue sky in front, hangs high in air the white saw of the
Pyrenees.&nbsp; High, I say, in air, for the land slopes, or
seems to slope, down from you to the mountain range, and all
their roots are lost in a dim sea of purple haze.&nbsp; But shut
out the snow line above, and you will find that the seeming haze
is none, but really a clear and richly varied distance of hills,
and woods, and towns, which have become invisible from the
contrast of their greens, and greys, and purples, with the glare
and dazzle of the spotless snows of spring.</p>
<p>There they stand, one straight continuous jagged wall, of
which no one point seems higher than another.&nbsp; From the Pic
d&rsquo;Ossau, by the Mont Perdu and the Maladetta to the Pic de
Lart, are peaks past counting&mdash;hard clear white against the
hard clear blue, and blazing with keen light beneath the high
southern sun.&nbsp; Each peak carries its little pet cushion of
cloud, hanging motionless a few hundred yards above in the blue
sky, a row of them as far as eye can see.&nbsp; But, ever and
anon, as afternoon draws on, one of those little clouds, seeming
tired of waiting at its post ever since sunrise, loses its
temper, boils, swells, settles down on its own private peak, and
explodes in a fierce thunderstorm down its own private valley,
without discomposing in the least its neighbour cloud-cushions
right and left.&nbsp; Faintly the roll of the thunder reaches the
ear.&nbsp; Across some great blackness of cloud and cliff, a tiny
spark darts down.&nbsp; A long wisp of mist sweeps rapidly toward
you across the lowlands, and a momentary brush of cold rain lays
the dust.&nbsp; And then the pageant is played out, and the
disturbed peak is left clear again in the blue sky for the rest
of the day, to gather another cloud-cushion when
to-morrow&rsquo;s sun shall rise.</p>
<p>To him who looks, day after day, on this astonishing natural
wall, stretching, without visible gap, for nearly three hundred
miles, it is easy to see why France not only is, but must be, a
different world from Spain.&nbsp; Even human thought cannot, to
any useful extent, fly over that great wall of homeless rock and
snow.&nbsp; On the other side there must needs be another folk,
with another tongue, other manners, other polities, and if not
another creed, yet surely with other, and utterly different,
conceptions of the universe, and of man&rsquo;s business
therein.&nbsp; Railroads may do somewhat.&nbsp; But what of one
railroad; or even of two, one on the ocean, one on the sea, two
hundred and seventy miles apart?&nbsp; Before French civilization
can inform and elevate the Spanish people you must &lsquo;plane
down the Pyrenees.&rsquo;</p>
<p>At Montrejeau, a pretty town upon a hill which overhangs the
Garonne, you find, again, verdure and a railroad; and, turning
your back upon the Pyrenees, run down the rich ugly vale of the
Garonne, through crops of exceeding richness&mdash;wheat, which
is reaped in July, to be followed by buckwheat reaped in October;
then by green crops to be cut in May, and that again by maize, to
be pulled in October, and followed by wheat and the same
rotation.</p>
<p>Thus you reach Toulouse, a noble city, of which it ill befits
a passer-through to speak.&nbsp; Volumes have been written on its
antiquities, and volumes on its history; and all of either that
my readers need know, they will find in Murray&rsquo;s
hand-book.</p>
<p>At Toulouse&mdash;or rather on leaving it to go
eastward&mdash;you become aware that you have passed into a fresh
region.&nbsp; The change has been, of course, gradual: but it has
been concealed from you by passing over the chilly dreary uplands
of Lannemezan.&nbsp; Now you find yourself at once in
Languedoc.&nbsp; You have passed from the Atlantic region into
the Mediterranean; from the old highlands of the wild Vascones,
into those lowlands of Gallia Narbonensis, reaching from the
head-waters of the Garonne to the mouths of the Rhone, which were
said to be more Italian than Italy itself.</p>
<p>The peculiarity of the district is its gorgeous
colouring.&nbsp; Everywhere, over rich plains, you look away to
low craggy banks of limestone, the grey whereof contrasts
strongly with the green of the lowland, and with the even richer
green of the mulberry orchards; and beyond them again, southward
to the now distant snows of the Pyrenees, and northward to the
orange downs and purple glens of the Cevennes, all blazing in the
blazing sun.&nbsp; Green, grey, orange, purple, and, in the
farthest distance, blue as of the heaven itself, make the land
one vast rainbow, and fit dwelling-place for its sunny folk,
still happy and industrious&mdash;once the most cultivated and
luxurious people in Europe.</p>
<p>As for their industry, it is hereditary.&nbsp; These lands
were, it may be, as richly and carefully tilled in the days of
Augustus C&aelig;sar as they are now; or rather, as they were at
the end of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; For, since then, the
delver and sower&mdash;for centuries the slave of the Roman, and,
for centuries after, the slave of Teutonic or Saracenic
conquerors&mdash;has become his own master, and his own landlord;
and an impulse has been given to industry, which is shown by trim
cottages, gay gardens, and fresh olive orchards, pushed up into
glens which in a state of nature would starve a goat.</p>
<p>The special culture of the country&mdash;more and more special
as we run eastward&mdash;is that of the mulberry, the almond, and
the olive.&nbsp; Along every hill-side, down every glen, lie
orchard-rows of the precious pollards.&nbsp; The mulberries are
of richest dark velvet green; the almonds, one glory of
rose-colour in early spring, are now of a paler and colder green;
the olives (as all the world knows) of a dusty grey, which looks
all the more desolate in the pruning time of early spring, when
half the boughs of the evergreen are cut out, leaving the trees
stripped as by a tempest, and are carried home for fire-wood in
the quaint little carts, with their solid creaking wheels, drawn
by dove-coloured kine.&nbsp; Very ancient are some of these
olives, or rather, olive-groups.&nbsp; For when the tree grows
old, it splits, and falls asunder, as do often our pollard
willows; the bark heals over on the inside of each fragment, and
what was one tree becomes many, springing from a single root, and
bearing such signs of exceeding age that one can well believe the
country tale, how in the olive grounds around Nismes are still
fruiting olives which have furnished oil for the fair Roman dames
who cooled themselves in the sacred fountain of Nemausa, in the
days of the twelve C&aelig;sars.</p>
<p>Between the pollard rows are everywhere the rows of vines, or
of what will be vines when summer comes, but are now black
knobbed and gnarled clubs, without a sign of life save here and
there one fat green shoot of leaf and tendril bursting forth from
the seemingly dead stick.</p>
<p>One who sees that sight may find a new meaning and beauty in
the mystic words, &lsquo;I am the vine, ye are the
branches.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is not merely the connection between
branch and stem, common to all trees; not merely the exhilarating
and seemingly inspiring properties of the grape, which made the
very heathens look upon it as the sacred and miraculous fruit,
the special gift of God; not merely the pruning out of the
unfruitful branches, to be burned as fire-wood, or&mdash;after
the old Roman fashion, which I believe endures still in these
parts&mdash;buried as manure at the foot of the parent stem; not
merely these, but the seeming death of the vine, shorn of all its
beauty, its fruitfulness, of every branch and twig which it had
borne the year before, and left unsightly and seemingly ruined,
to its winter&rsquo;s sleep; and then bursting forth again, by an
irresistible inward life, into fresh branches spreading and
trailing far and wide, and tossing their golden tendrils to the
sun.</p>
<p>This thought, surely&mdash;the emblem of the living Church
springing from the corpse of the dead Christ, who yet should rise
and be alive for evermore&mdash;enters into, it may be forms an
integral part of, the meaning of, that prophecy of all
prophecies.</p>
<p>One ought to look, with something of filial reverence, on the
agriculture of the district into which we are penetrating; for it
is the parent of our own.&nbsp; From hence, or strictly speaking
from the Mediterranean shore beyond us, spread northward and
westward through France, Belgium, and Britain, all the tillage
which we knew&mdash;at least till a hundred years
ago&mdash;beyond the prim&aelig;val plan of clearing, or
surface-burning, the forests, growing miserable white crops as
long as they would yield, and then letting the land relapse, for
twenty years, into miserable pasture.&nbsp; This process (which
lingered thirty years ago in remote parts of Devon), and nothing
better, seems to have been that change of cultivated lands which
Tacitus ascribes to the ancient Germans.&nbsp; Rotation of crops,
in any true sense, came to us from Provence and Languedoc; and
with it, subsoiling; irrigation; all our artificial grasses, with
lucerne at the head of the list; our peas and beans; some of our
most important roots; almost all our garden flowers, vegetables,
fruits, the fig, the mulberry, the vine&mdash;(the olive and the
maize came with them from the East, but dared go no further
north)&mdash;and I know not what more; till we may say,
that&mdash;saving subsoil-draining, which their climate does not
need&mdash;the ancestors of these good folks were better farmers
fifteen hundred years ago, than too many of our countrymen are at
this day.</p>
<p>So they toil, and thrive, and bless God, under the glorious
sun; and as for rain&mdash;they have not had rain for these two
months&mdash;(I speak of April, 1864)&mdash;and, though the white
limestone dust is ankle deep on every road, say that they want
none for two months more, thanks, it is to be presumed, to their
deep tillage, which puts the plant-roots out of the reach of
drought.&nbsp; In spring they feed their silkworms, and wind
their silk.&nbsp; In summer they reap their crops, and hang the
maize-heads from their rafters for their own winter food, while
they sell the wheat to the poor creatures, objects of their pity,
who live in towns, and are forced to eat white bread.&nbsp; From
spring to autumn they have fruit, and to spare, for themselves
and for their customers; and with the autumn comes the vintage,
and all its classic revelries.&nbsp; A happy folk&mdash;under a
happy clime; which yet has its drawbacks, like all climes on
earth.&nbsp; Terrible thunderstorms sweep over it, hail-laden,
killing, battering, drowning, destroying in an hour the labours
of the year; and there are ugly mistral winds likewise, of which
it may be fairly said, that he who can face an eight days&rsquo;
mistral, without finding his life a burden, must be either a very
valiant man, or have neither liver nor mucous membrane.</p>
<p>For on a sudden, after still and burning weather, the
thermometer suddenly falls from thirty to forty degrees; and out
of the north-west rushes a chilly hurricane, blowing fiercer and
fiercer each day toward nightfall, and lulling in the small
hours, only to burst forth again at sunrise.&nbsp; Parched are
all lips and eyes; for the air is full of dust, yea, even of
gravel which cuts like hail.&nbsp; Aching are all right-sides;
for the sudden chill brings on all manner of liver complaints and
indigestions.&nbsp; All who can afford it, draw tight the
jalousies, and sulk in darkness; the leaves are parched, as by an
Atlantic gale; the air is filled with lurid haze, as in an
English north-east wind; and no man can breathe freely, or eat
his bread with joy, until the plague is past.</p>
<p>What is the cause of these mistrals; why all the cold air of
Central France should be suddenly seized with madness, and rush
into the sea between the Alps and the Pyrenees; whether the great
heat of the sun, acting on the Mediterranean basin, raises up
thence&mdash;as from the Gulf of Mexico&mdash;columns of warm
light air, whose place has to be supplied by colder and heavier
air from inland; whether the north-west mistral is, or is not, a
diverted north-easter; an arctic current which, in its right road
toward the tropics across the centre of France, has been called
to the eastward of the Pyrenees (instead of, as usual, to the
westward), by the sudden demand for cold air,&mdash;all this let
men of science decide; and having discovered what causes the
mistral, discover also what will prevent it.&nbsp; That would be
indeed a triumph of science, and a boon to tortured humanity.</p>
<p>But after all, man is a worse enemy to man than any of the
brute forces of nature: and a more terrible scourge than mistral
or tempest swept over this land six hundred years ago, when it
was, perhaps, the happiest and the most civilized portion of
Europe.&nbsp; This was the scene of the Albigense Crusade: a
tragedy of which the true history will never, perhaps, be
written.&nbsp; It was not merely a persecution of real or
supposed heretics; it was a national war, embittered by the
ancient jealousies of race, between the Frank aristocracy of the
north and the Gothic aristocracy of the south, who had perhaps
acquired, with their half-Roman, half-Saracen civilization,
mixtures both of Roman and of Saracen blood.&nbsp; As
&ldquo;Aquitanians,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Proven&ccedil;aux,&rdquo;&mdash;Roman Provincials, as they
proudly called themselves, speaking the Langue d&rsquo;Oc, and
looking down on the northerners who spoke the Langue d&rsquo;Oil
as barbarians, they were in those days guilty of the capital
crime of being foreigners; and as foreigners they were
exterminated.&nbsp; What their religious tenets were, we shall
never know.&nbsp; With the Vaudois, Waldenses, &ldquo;poor men of
Lyons,&rdquo; they must not be for a moment confounded.&nbsp;
Their creed remains to us only in the calumnies of their
enemies.&nbsp; The confessions in the archives of the Tolosan
Inquisition, as elicited either under torture or fear of torture,
deserve no confidence whatsoever.&nbsp; And as for the
licentiousness of their poetry&mdash;which has been alleged as
proof of their profligacy&mdash;I can only say, that it is no
more licentious than the <i>fabliaux</i> of their French
conquerors, while it is far more delicate and refined.&nbsp;
Humanity, at least, has done justice to the Troubadours of the
south; and confessed, even in the Middle Age, that to them the
races of the north owed grace of expression, delicacy of
sentiment, and that respect for women which soon was named
chivalry; which looks on woman, not with suspicion and contempt,
but with trust and adoration; and is not ashamed to obey her as
&ldquo;mistress,&rdquo; instead of treating her as a slave.</p>
<p>But these Albigenses must have had something in their hearts
for which it was worth while to die.&nbsp; At Aviguonet, that
little grey town on the crag above the railway, they burst into
the place, maddened by the cruelties of the Inquisitor (an
archdeacon, if I recollect rightly, from Toulouse), and slew him
then and there.&nbsp; They were shut up in the town, and
withstood heroically a long and miserable siege.&nbsp; At last
they were starved out.&nbsp; The conquerors offered them their
lives&mdash;so say the French stories&mdash;if they would
recant.&nbsp; But they would not.&nbsp; They were thrust together
into one of those stone-walled enclosures below the town, heaped
over with vine-twigs and maize-stalks, and burned alive; and
among them a young lady of the highest rank, who had passed
through all the horrors of the siege, and was offered life,
wealth, and honour, if she would turn.</p>
<p>Surely profligate infidels do not so die; and these poor
souls, whatever were their sins or their confusions, must be
numbered among the heroes of the human race.</p>
<p>But the world has mended since then, and so has the French
character.&nbsp; Even before the Revolution of 1793, it was
softening fast.&nbsp; The massacres of 1562 were not as horrible
as those of the Albigense Crusade, though committed&mdash;which
the former were not&mdash;under severe provocation.&nbsp; The
massacres of 1793&mdash;in spite of all that has been
said&mdash;were far less horrible than those of 1562, though they
were the outpouring of centuries of pardonable fury and
indignation.&nbsp; The crimes of the Terreur Blanche, at the
Restoration&mdash;though ugly things were done in the south,
especially in Nismes&mdash;were far less horrible again; though
they were, for the most part, acts of direct personal retaliation
on the republicans of 1793.&nbsp; And since then the French heart
has softened fast.&nbsp; The irritating sense of hereditary wrong
has passed away.&nbsp; The Frenchman conceives that justice is
done to him, according to his own notions thereof.&nbsp; He has
his share of the soil, without which no Celtic populace will ever
be content.&nbsp; He has fair play in the battle of life; and a
&lsquo;Carri&egrave;re ouverte aux talens.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has
equal law and justice between man and man.&nbsp; And he is
content; and under the sunshine of contentment and self-respect,
his native good-nature expands; and he shows himself what he is,
not merely a valiant and capable, but an honest, kindly,
charitable man.</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; France has grown better, and has been growing
better, I believe, for centuries past.&nbsp; And the difference
between the France of the middle age and the France of the
present day, is fitly typified by the difference between the new
Carcassone below and the old Carcassone above, where every
traveller, even if he be no antiquarian, should stop and gaze
about a while.</p>
<p>The contrast is complete; and one for which a man who loves
his fellow-men should surely return devout thanks to Almighty
God.&nbsp; Below, on the west bank of the river, is the new town,
spreading and growing, unwalled, for its fortifications are now
replaced by boulevards and avenues; full of handsome houses;
squares where, beneath the plane-tree shade, marble fountains
pour out perpetual health and coolness; manufactories of gay
woollens; healthy, cheerful, market folk; comfortable burghers;
industry and peace.&nbsp; We pass outside to the great basin of
the Canal de Languedoc, and get more avenues of stately trees,
and among them the red marble statue of Riquet, whose genius
planned and carried out the mighty canal which joins the ocean to
the sea; the wonder of its day, which proved the French to be, at
least in the eighteenth century, the master-engineers of the
world; the only people who still inherited the mechanical skill
and daring of their Roman civilizers.&nbsp; Riquet bore the
labour of that canal&mdash;and the calumny and obstructiveness,
too, which tried to prevent its formation; France bore the
expense; Louis Quatorze, of course, the glory; and no one, it is
to be feared, the profit: for the navigation of the Garonne at
the one extremity, and of the Mediterranean shallows at the
other, were left unimproved till of late years, and the canal has
become practically useful only just in time to be superseded by
the railroads.</p>
<p>Now cross the Aude.&nbsp; Look down upon the willow and aspen
copses, where over the heads of busy washerwomen, the nightingale
and the hippolais crowded together away from the dusty plains and
downs, shake the copses with their song; and then toil upward to
the grey fortress tower on the grey limestone knoll; and pass,
out of nature and her pure sunshine, into the black shadow of the
unnatural Middle Age; into the region of dirt and darkness,
cruelty and fear; grim fortresses, crowded houses, narrow
streets, and pestilence.&nbsp; Pass through the outer circle of
walls, of the latter part of the thirteenth century, to
examine&mdash;for their architecture is a whole history engraved
in stones&mdash;the ancient walls of the inner enceinte; massive
Roman below, patched with striped Visigothic work, with mean and
hasty Moorish, with graceful, though heavy, Romanesque of the
times of the Troubadours; a whole museum of ancient
fortifications, which has been restored, stone by stone, through
the learning of M. Viollet le Duc and the public spirit of the
late Emperor.&nbsp; Pass in under the gateway and give yourself
up to legends.&nbsp; There grins down on you the broad image of
the mythic Dame Carcas, who defended the town single-handed
against Charlemagne, till this tower fell down by miracle, and
let in the Christian host.&nbsp; But do not believe that she gave
to the place its name of Carcassone; for the first syllable of
the word is hint enough that it was, long ere her days, a Celtic
caer, or hill-fortress.&nbsp; Pause at the inner gate; you need
not exactly believe that when the English Crusader, Simon de
Montfort, burst it open, and behold, the town within was empty
and desolate, he cried: &lsquo;Did I not tell you that those
heretics were devils; and behold, being devils, they have
vanished into air.&rsquo;&nbsp; You must believe, I fear, that of
the great multitude who had been crowded, starving, and
fever-stricken within, he found four hundred poor wretches who
had lingered behind, and burnt them all alive.&nbsp; You need not
believe that that is the mouth of the underground passage which
runs all the way from the distant hills, through which the
Vicomte de Beziers, after telling Simon de Montfort and the Abbot
of Citeaux that he would sooner be flayed alive than betray the
poor folk who had taken refuge with him, got them all safe away,
men, women, and children.&nbsp; You need not believe that that
great vaulted chamber was the &lsquo;Chamber of the
Inquisition.&rsquo;&nbsp; But you must believe that those two
ugly rings let into the roof were put there for the torture of
the cord; and that many a naked wretch has dangled from them ere
now, confessing anything and everything that he&mdash;or, alas
she&mdash;was bidden.&nbsp; But these and their like are the
usual furniture of every medi&aelig;val court of justice; and
torture was not altogether abolished in France till the latter
part of the eighteenth century.&nbsp; You need not believe,
again, that that circular tower on the opposite side of the town
was really the &lsquo;Tower of the Inquisition;&rsquo; for many a
feudal lord, besides the Inquisitors, had their dens of cruelty
in those old times.&nbsp; You need not even believe&mdash;though
it is too likely to be true&mdash;that that great fireplace in
the little first-floor room served for the torture of the
scarpines.&nbsp; But you must believe that in that little round
den beneath it, only approached by a trap in the floor, two
skeletons were found fastened by those chains to that central
pillar, having died and rotted forgotten in that horrid
oubliette&mdash;how many centuries ago?</p>
<p>&lsquo;Plusieurs ont gemis l&agrave; bas,&rsquo; said M.
Viollet le Duc&rsquo;s foreman of the works, as he led us out of
that evil hole, to look, with eyes and hearts refreshed by the
change, at a curious Visigothic tower, in which the good bishop
Sidonius Apollinaris may have told of the last Burgundian
invasion of his Auvergne to the good king Theodoric of the West
Goths.</p>
<p>If anyone wishes to learn what the Middle Ages were like, let
him go to Carcassone and see.</p>
<p>And now onward to Narbonne&mdash;or rather, to what was once
Narbonne; one of the earliest colonies ever founded by the
Romans; then the capital of the Visigothic kingdom; then of an
Arab kingdom: now a dull fortified town&mdash;of a filth
unspeakable, and not to be forgotten or forgiven.&nbsp; Stay not
therein an hour, lest you take fever, or worse: but come out of
the gate over the drawbridge, and stroll down the canal.&nbsp;
Look back a moment, though, across the ditch.&nbsp; The whole
face of the wall is a museum of Roman gods, tombs, inscriptions,
bas-reliefs: the wreck of Martial&rsquo;s &lsquo;Pulcherrima
Narbo,&rsquo; the old Roman city, which was demolished by Louis
XIII., to build the ugly fortifications of the then new fashion,
now antiquated and useless.&nbsp; Take one glance, and walk on,
to look at live Nature&mdash;far more interesting than dead
Art.</p>
<p>Everything fattens in the close damp air of the canal.&nbsp;
The great flat, with its heavy crops, puts you in mind of the
richest English lowland&mdash;save for the total want of old
meadows.&nbsp; The weeds on the bank are English in type, only
larger and richer&mdash;as becomes the climate.&nbsp; But as you
look among them, you see forms utterly new and strange, whose
kinship you cannot fancy, but which remind you that you are
nearing Italy, and Greece, and Africa.&nbsp; And in the hedges
are great bay-trees; and inside them, orchards of standard fig
and white mulberry, with its long yearling shoots of glorious
green&mdash;soon to be stripped bare for the silkworms; and here
and there long lines of cypresses, black against the bright green
plain and bright blue sky.&nbsp; No; you are not in
Britain.&nbsp; Certainly not; for there is a drake (not a duck)
quacking with feeble treble in that cypress, six feet over your
head; and in Britain drakes do not live in trees.&nbsp; You look
for the climbing palmipede, and see nothing: nor will you see;
for the quacker is a tiny green tree-frog, who holds on by the
suckers at the ends of his toes (with which he can climb a pane
of glass, like a fly), and has learnt the squirrel&rsquo;s art of
going invisible, without &lsquo;the receipt of fern-seed,&rsquo;
by simply keeping always on the further side of the branch.</p>
<p>But come back; for the air even here is suggestive of cholera
and fever.&nbsp; The uncleanliness of these Narbonnois is
shameless and shocking; and &lsquo;immondices&rsquo; of every
kind lie festering in the rainless heat.&nbsp; The sickened
botanist retreats, and buys a bottle of Eau
Bully&mdash;<i>alias</i> aromatic vinegar.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There, crowding yon hill, with handsome houses and churches,
is Beziers&mdash;the blood-stained city.&nbsp; Beneath the
pavement of that church, it is said, lie heaped together the
remains of thousands of men, women, and children, slaughtered
around their own altars, on that fatal day, when the Legate
Amalric, asked by the knights how they should tell Catholics from
heretics, cried, &ldquo;Kill them all&mdash;the Lord will know
his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We will pass on.&nbsp; We have had enough of horrors.&nbsp;
And, beside, we are longing to hurry onward; for we are nearing
the Mediterranean now.&nbsp; There are small skiffs lying under
the dark tower of Agde, another place of blood, fitly built of
black lava blocks, the offspring of the nether pit.&nbsp; The
railway cuts through rolling banks of dark lava; and now, ahead
of us, is the conical lava-hill of Cette, and the mouth of the
Canal du Midi.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>There it is, at last.&nbsp; The long line of heavenly blue;
and over it, far away, the white-peaked lateen sails, which we
have seen in pictures since our childhood; and there, close to
the rail, beyond the sand-hills, delicate wavelets are breaking
for ever on a yellow beach, each in exactly the same place as the
one which fell before.&nbsp; One glance shows us children of the
Atlantic, that we are on a tideless sea.</p>
<p>There it is,&mdash;the sacred sea.&nbsp; The sea of all
civilization, and almost all history, girdled by the fairest
countries in the world; set there that human beings from all its
shores might mingle with each other, and become humane&mdash;the
sea of Egypt, of Palestine, of Greece, of Italy, of Byzant, of
Marseilles, and this Narbonnaise, &lsquo;more Roman than Rome
herself,&rsquo; to which we owe the greater part of our own
progress; the sea, too, Algeria and Carthage, and Cyrene, and
fair lands now desolate, surely not to be desolate for
ever;&mdash;the sea of civilization.&nbsp; Not only to the
Christian, nor to the classic scholar, but to every man to whom
the progress of his race from barbarism toward humanity is dear,
should the Mediterranean Sea be one of the most august and
precious objects on this globe; and the first sight of it should
inspire reverence and delight, as of coming home&mdash;home to a
rich inheritance in which he has long believed by hearsay, but
which he sees at last with his own mortal corporal eyes.</p>
<p>Exceedingly beautiful is that first view of the sea from
Cette, though altogether different in character from the views of
the Mediterranean which are common in every gallery of
pictures.&nbsp; There is nothing to remind one of Claude, or
Vernet, or Stanfield.&nbsp; No mountain-ranges far aloft, no
cliffs toppling into the water, with convents and bastides
perched on their crags; and seaports, with their land-locked
harbours, and quaint lighthouses, nestling on the brink.&nbsp;
That scenery begins on the other side of the Rhone mouth, and
continues, I believe, almost without interruption, to the shores
of Southern Palestine, one girdle of perpetual beauty.</p>
<p>But here, the rail runs along a narrow strip of sand, covered
with straggling vines, and tall white iris, between the sea and
the great Etang de Thau, a long narrow salt-lake, beyond which
the wide lowlands of the Herault slide gently down, There is not
a mountain, hardly a hill, visible for miles: but all around is
the great sheet of blue glassy water: while the air is as glassy
clear as the water, and through it, at seemingly immense
distances, the land shows purple and orange, blue and grey, till
the landscape is one great rainbow.&nbsp; White ships slide to
and from far-off towns; fishermen lounge on the marshes, drying
long lines of net.&nbsp; Everywhere is vastness, freedom, repose
gentle and yet not melancholy; because with all, under the
burning blue, there is that fresh wholesome heat, which in itself
is life, and youth, and joy.</p>
<p>Beyond, nearer the mouths of the Rhone, there are, so men say,
desolate marshes, tenanted by herds of half-wild horses; foul
mud-banks, haunted by the pelican and the flamingo, and waders
from the African shore; a region half land, half water, where
dwell savage folk, decimated by fever and ague.&nbsp; But short
of those Bouches du Rh&ocirc;ne, the railway turns to the north,
toward Montpellier and</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Arli, dove il
Rhodano stagna.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And at Cette ends this little tour from Ocean to Sea, with the
wish that he who next travels that way may have as glorious
weather, and as agreeable a companion, as the writer of these
lines had in 1864.</p>

<h3>I.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Exmoor</span>.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were riding up from Lynmouth, on
a pair of ragged ponies, Claude Mellot and I, along the gorge of
Watersmeet.&nbsp; And as we went we talked of many things; and
especially of some sporting book which we had found at the
Lyndale Hotel the night before, and which we had not by any means
admired. <a name="citation225b"></a><a href="#footnote225b"
class="citation">[225b]</a>&nbsp; I do not object to sporting
books in general, least of all to one on Exmoor.&nbsp; No place
in England is more worthy of one.&nbsp; There is no place whose
beauties and peculiarities are more likely to be thrown into
strong relief by being looked at with a sportsman&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; It is so with all forests and moorlands.&nbsp; The
spirit of Robin Hood and Johnny of Breadislee is theirs.&nbsp;
They are remnants of the home of man&rsquo;s fierce youth, still
consecrated to the genius of animal excitement and savage
freedom; after all, not the most ignoble qualities of human
nature.&nbsp; Besides, there is no better method of giving a
living picture of a whole country than by taking some one feature
of it as a guide, and bringing all other observations into
harmony with that original key.&nbsp; Even in merely scientific
books this is very possible.&nbsp; Look, for instance, at Hugh
Miller&rsquo;s &lsquo;Old Red Sandstone,&rsquo; &lsquo;The Voyage
of the Beagle,&rsquo; and Professor Forbes&rsquo;s work (we had
almost said epic poem) on &lsquo;Glaciers.&rsquo;&nbsp; Even an
agricultural writer, if he have a real insight in him&mdash;if he
have anything of that secret of the <i>pi&ugrave; nel&rsquo;
uno</i>, &lsquo;the power of discovering the infinite in the
finite;&rsquo; of seeing, like a poet, trivial phenomena in their
true relation to the whole of the great universe into which they
are so cunningly fitted; if he has learned to look at all things
and men, down to the meanest, as living lessons written with the
finger of God; if, in short, he has any true dramatic power: then
he may impart to that apparently muddiest of sciences a poetic or
a humorous tone, and give the lie to Mephistopheles when he
dissuades Faust from farming as an occupation too mean and filthy
for a man of genius.&nbsp; The poetry of agriculture remains as
yet, no doubt, unwritten, and the comedy of it also; though its
farce-tragedy has been too often extensively enacted in
practice&mdash;unconsciously to the players.&nbsp; As for the old
&lsquo;pastoral&rsquo; school, it only flourished before
agriculture really existed&mdash;that is, before sound science,
hard labour, and economy were necessary&mdash;and has been for
the last two hundred years simply a dream.&nbsp; Nevertheless, as
signs of what may be done even now by a genial man with so
stubborn a subject as &lsquo;turnips, barley, clover,
wheat,&rsquo; it is worth while to look at old Arthur
Young&rsquo;s books, both travels and treatises; and also at
certain very spirited &lsquo;Chronicles of a Clay Farm,&rsquo; by
Talpa, which teem with humour and wisdom.</p>
<p>In sporting literature&mdash;a tenth muse, exclusively
indigenous to England&mdash;the same observation holds good
tenfold.&nbsp; Some of our most perfect topographical sketches
have been the work of sportsmen.&nbsp; Old Izaak Walton, and his
friend Cotton, of Dovedale, whose names will last as long as
their rivers, have been followed by a long train of worthy
pupils.&nbsp; White&rsquo;s &lsquo;History of Selborne;&rsquo;
Sir Humphry Davy&rsquo;s &lsquo;Salmonia;&rsquo; &lsquo;The Wild
Sports of the West;&rsquo; Mr. St. John&rsquo;s charming little
works on Highland Shooting; and, above all, Christopher
North&rsquo;s &lsquo;Recreations&rsquo;&mdash;delightful book! to
be read and re-read, the tenth time even as the first&mdash;an
inexhaustible fairy well, springing out of the granite rock of
the sturdy Scotch heart, through the tender green turf of a
genial boyish old age.&nbsp; Sporting books, when they are not
filled&mdash;as they need never be&mdash;with low slang, and ugly
sketches of ugly characters&mdash;who hang on to the skirts of
the sporting world, as they would to the skirts of any other
world, in default of the sporting one&mdash;form an integral and
significant, and, it may be, an honourable and useful part, of
the English literature of this day; and, therefore, all
shallowness, vulgarity, stupidity, or bookmaking in that class,
must be as severely attacked as in novels and poems.&nbsp; We
English owe too much to our field sports to allow people to talk
nonsense about them.</p>
<p>Claude smiled at some such words of mine that day.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You talk often of the poetry of sport.&nbsp; I can see
nothing in it but animal excitement, and a certain quantity, I
suppose, of that animal cunning which the Red Indian possesses in
common with the wolf and the cat, and any other beast of
prey.&nbsp; As a fact, the majority of sportsmen are of the most
unpoetical type of manhood.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;More unpoetical than the average man of business, or
man of law, Claude?&nbsp; Or even than the average
preacher?&nbsp; I believe, on the contrary, that for most of them
it is sport which at once keeps alive and satisfies what you
would call their &aelig;sthetic faculties, and so&mdash;smile if
you will&mdash;helps to make them purer, simpler, more genial
men.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Little enough of &aelig;sthetic appears either in their
conversation or their writing.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Esau is a dumb soul, especially here in England; but he
has as deep a heart in him as Jacob, nevertheless, and as
tender.&nbsp; Do you fancy that the gentleman over whose book we
were grumbling last night, attached no more to his own simple
words than you do?&nbsp; His account of a stag&rsquo;s run looks
bald enough to you: but to him (unless Diana struck him blind for
intruding on her privacy) what a whole poem of memories there
must be in those few words,&mdash;&ldquo;Turned down * * Water
for a mile, and crossed the forest to Watersmeet, where he was
run into after a gallant race.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A whole poem?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why not?&nbsp; How can there be less, if he had eyes to
see?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does he fancy that it is an account of a run to tell us
that &ldquo;Found at * * * * cover, held away at a slapping pace
for * * * * Barn, then turned down the * * * Water for a mile,
and crossed the Forest; made for * * * Hill, but being headed,
went by ** ** woods to D * * * where he was run into after a
gallant race of * * * * hours and * * * *miles&rdquo;?&nbsp; It
is nearly as dull as a history book!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nay, I never rode with those staghounds: and yet I can
fill up his outline for him, wherever the stag was roused.&nbsp;
Do you think that he never marked how the panting cavalcade rose
and fell on the huge mile-long waves of that vast heather sea;
how one long brown hill after another sunk down, greyer and
greyer, behind them, and one long grey hill after another swelled
up browner and browner before them; and how the sandstone rattled
and flew beneath their feet, as the great horses, like
Homer&rsquo;s of old, &ldquo;devoured up the plain;&rdquo; and
how they struggled down the hill-side, through bushes and rocks,
and broad slipping rattling sheets of screes, and saw beneath
them stag and pack galloping down the shallow glittering
river-bed, throwing up the shingle, striking out the water in
long glistening sheets; and how they too swept after them, down
the flat valley, rounding crag and headland, which opened one
after another in interminable vista, along the narrow strip of
sand and rushes, speckled with stunted, moss-bearded,
heather-bedded hawthorns, between the great grim lifeless
mountain walls?&nbsp; Did he feel no pleasant creeping of the
flesh that day at the sound of his own horse-hoofs, as they swept
through the long ling with a sound as soft as the brushing of a
woman&rsquo;s tresses, and then rang down on the spongy, black,
reverberating soil, chipping the honey-laden fragrant heather
blossoms, and tossing them out in a rosy shower?&nbsp; Or, if
that were really too slight a thing for the observation of an
average sportsman, surely he must recollect the dying away of the
hounds&rsquo; voices, as the woodland passes engulfed them,
whether it were Brendon or at Badger-worthy, or any other place;
how they brushed through the narrow forest paths, where the ashes
were already golden, while the oaks still kept their sombre
green, and the red leaves and berries of the mountain-ash showed
bright beneath the dark forest aisles; and how all of a sudden
the wild outcry before them seemed to stop and concentrate,
thrown back, louder and louder as they rode, off the same echoing
crag; till at a sudden turn of the road there stood the stag
beneath them in the stream, his back against the black rock with
its green cushions of dripping velvet, knee-deep in the clear
amber water, the hounds around him, some struggling and swimming
in the deep pool, some rolling and tossing and splashing in a
mad, half-terrified ring, as he reared into the air on his great
haunches, with the sparkling beads running off his red mane, and
dropping on his knees, plunged his antlers down among them, with
blows which would have each brought certain death with it if the
yielding water had not broken the shock.&nbsp; Do you think that
he does not remember the death?&nbsp; The huge carcass dragged
out of the stream, followed by dripping, panting dogs; the
blowing of the mort, and the last wild halloo, when the horn-note
and the voices rang through the autumn woods, and rolled up the
smooth flat mountain sides; and Brendon answered Countisbury, and
Countisbury sent it on to Lynmouth hills, till it swept out of
the gorge and died away upon the Severn sea?&nbsp; And then, does
he not remember the pause, and the revulsion, and the feeling of
sadness and littleness, almost of shame, as he looked up for the
first time&mdash;one can pardon his not having done so
before&mdash;and saw where he was, and the beauty of the
hill-sides, with the lazy autumn clouds crawling about their
tops, and the great sheets of screes, glaciers of stone covering
acres and acres of the smooth hill-side, eating far into the
woods below, bowing down the oak scrubs with their weight, and
the circular sweeps of down, flecked with innumerable dark spots
of gorse, each of them guarded where they open into the river
chasm by two fortresses of &ldquo;giant-snouted
crags,&rdquo;&mdash;delicate pink and grey sandstone, from which
blocks and crumbling boulders have been toppling slowly down for
ages, beneath the frost and the whirlwind, and now lie in long
downward streams upon the slope, as if the mountain had been
weeping tears of stone?&nbsp; And then, as the last notes of the
mort had died away, did not there come over him an awe at the
silence of the woods, not broken, but deepened, by the unvarying
monotone of the roaring stream beneath, which flashed and
glittered, half-hidden in the dark chasm, in clear brown pools
reflecting every leaf and twig, in boiling pits and walls of
foam, ever changing, and yet for ever the fleeting on past the
poor dead reeking stag and the silent hounds lying about on the
moss-embroidered stones, their lolling tongues showing like
bright crimson sparkles in the deep rich Venetian air of the
green sombre shades; while the startled water-ousel, with his
white breast, flitted a few yards and stopped to stare from a
rock&rsquo;s point at the strange intruders; and a single
stock-dove, out of the bosom of the wood, began calling sadly and
softly, with a dreamy peaceful moan?&nbsp; Did he not see and
hear all this, for surely it was there to see and
hear?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not he.&nbsp; The eye only sees that which it brings
within the power of seeing; and all I shall say of him is, that a
certain apparition in white leathers was at one period of its
appearance dimly conscious of equestrian motion towards a certain
brown two-horned phenomenon, and other spotted phenomena, at
which he had been taught by habit to make the articulate noises
&ldquo;stag&rdquo; and &ldquo;hounds,&rdquo; among certain grey,
and green, and brown phenomena, at which the same habit and the
example of his fellows had taught him to say, &ldquo;Rock, and
wood, and mountain,&rdquo; and perhaps the further noises of
&ldquo;Lovely, splendid, majestic.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;As usual, sir!&nbsp; You dwellers in Babylon fancy that
you have the monopoly of all the intellect, and all the taste,
because you earn your livings by talking about pretty things, and
painting pretty things: little do you suspect, shut up together
in your little literary worlds, and your artistic worlds, how
many thousands of us outside barbarians there are who see as
clearly, and enjoy as deeply as you do: but hold their tongues
about their own feelings, simply because they have never been
driven by emptiness of pocket to look round for methods of
expressing them.&nbsp; And, after all&mdash;how much of nature
can you express?&nbsp; You confest yourself yesterday baffled by
all the magnificence around you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes! to paint it worthily one would require to be a
Turner, a Copley Fielding, and a Creswick, all in one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And did you ever remark how such scenes as this gorge
of the &ldquo;Watersmeet&rdquo; stir up a feeling of shame,
almost of peevishness, before the sense of a mysterious meaning
which we ought to understand and cannot?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Our torments do by length of time become our elements;
and painful as that sensation is to the earnest artist, he will
feel it, I fancy, at last sublime itself into an habitually
gentle, reverent, almost melancholy tone of mind, as of a man
bearing the burden of an infinite and wonderful message which his
own frivolity and laziness hinder him from speaking
out.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Then it should beget in him, too, something of merciful
indulgence towards the seeming stupidity of those who see, after
all, only a very little shallower than he does into the
unfathomable depths of nature.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Well, sporting books and sportsmen seem to me, by their
very object, not to be worth troubling our heads about.&nbsp; Out
of nothing, comes nothing.&nbsp; See, my hands are as soft as any
lady&rsquo;s in Belgravia.&nbsp; I could not, to save my life,
lift a hundredweight a foot off the ground; while you have been a
wild man of the woods, a leaper of ditches, a rower of races, and
a wanton destroyer of all animal life: and yet&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You would hint politely that you are as open as me to
all noble, and chivalrous, and truly manly emotions?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What think you?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That you are far worthier in such matters than I,
friend.&nbsp; But do not forget that it may be your intellect,
and your profession&mdash;in one word, Heaven&rsquo;s
mercy&mdash;which have steered you clear of shoals upon which you
will find the mass of our class founder.&nbsp; Woe to the class
or the nation which has no manly physical training!&nbsp; Look at
the manners, the morals, the faces of the young men of the
shopkeeping classes, if you wish to see the effects of utterly
neglecting the physical development of man; <a
name="citation235"></a><a href="#footnote235"
class="citation">[235]</a> of fancying that all the muscular
activity he requires under the sun is to be able to stand behind
a counter, or sit on a desk-stool without tumbling off.&nbsp; Be
sure, be sure, that ever since the days of the Persians of old,
effeminacy, if not twin-sister of cowardice and dishonesty, has
always gone hand in hand with them.&nbsp; To that utter neglect
of any exercises which call out fortitude, patience,
self-dependence, and daring, I attribute a great deal of the low
sensuality, the conceited vulgarity, the want of a high sense of
honour, which is increasing just now among the middle classes;
and from which the navigator, the engineer, the miner, and the
sailor are comparatively free.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And perhaps, too, that similar want of a high sense of
honour, which seems, from the religious periodicals, to pervade a
large proportion of a certain more venerable
profession?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seriously, Claude, I believe you are not far
wrong.&nbsp; But we are getting on delicate ground there: however
I have always found, that of whatever profession he may
be&mdash;to travestie Shakspeare&rsquo;s words,&mdash;</p>

Is fit for treason&rsquo;s direst stratagems&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and so forth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Civil to me!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you have a sporting soul in you, like hundreds of
other Englishmen who never handled rod or gun; or you would not
be steering for Exmoor to-day.&nbsp; If a lad be a genius, you
may trust him to find some original means for developing his
manly energies, whether in art, agriculture, science, or travels,
discovery, and commerce.&nbsp; But if he be not, as there are a
thousand chances to one he will not be, then whatever you teach
him, let the two first things be, as they were with the old
Persians, &ldquo;To speak the truth, and to draw the
bow.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>By this time we had reached the stream, just clearing from the
last night&rsquo;s showers.&nbsp; A long transparent amber
shallow, dimpled with fleeting silver rings by rising trout; a
low cascade of green-veined snow; a deep dark pool of swirling
orange-brown, walled in with heathery rocks, and paved with
sandstone slabs and boulders, distorted by the changing
refractions of the eddies,&mdash;sight delicious to the
angler.</p>
<p>I commenced my sport at once, while Claude wandered up the
glen to sketch a knoll of crags, on which a half-wild moorland
pony, the only living thing in sight, stood staring and snuffing
at the intruder, his long mane and tail streaming out wildly
against the sky.</p>
<p>I had fished on for some hour or two; Claude had long since
disappeared among the hills; I fancied myself miles from any
human being, when a voice at my elbow startled me:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A bleak place for fishing this, sir!&rsquo;</p>
<p>I turned; it was an old grey-whiskered labouring man, with
pick and spade on shoulder, who had crept on me unawares beneath
the wall of the neighbouring deer-cover.&nbsp; Keen honest eyes
gleamed out from his brown, scarred, weather-beaten face; and as
he settled himself against a rock with the deliberate intention
of a chat, I commenced by asking after the landlord of those
parts, well known and honoured both by sportsman and by
farmer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;He was gone to Malta&mdash;a warmer place that than
Exmoor.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! have you been in Malta?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes, he had been in Malta, and in stranger places yet.&nbsp;
He had been a sailor: he had seen the landing in Egypt, and heard
the French cannon thundering vainly from the sand-hills on the
English boats.&nbsp; He had himself helped to lift Abercrombie up
the ship&rsquo;s side to the death-bed of the brave.&nbsp; He had
seen Caraccioli hanging at his own yard-arm, and heard (so he
said, I know not how correctly) Lady Hamilton order out the barge
herself, and row round the frigate of the murdered man, to glut
her eyes with her revenge.&nbsp; He had seen, too, the ghastly
corpse floating upright, when Nelson and the enchantress met
their victim, returned from the sea-depths to stare at them, as
Banquo&rsquo;s ghost upon Macbeth.&nbsp; But she was &lsquo;a
mortal fine woman, was Lady Hamilton, though she was a queer one,
and cruel kind to the sailors; and many a man she saved from
flogging; and one from hanging, too; that was a marine that got
a-stealing; for Nelson, though he was kind enough, yet it was a
word and a blow with him; and quite right he, sir; for there be
such rascals on board ship, that if you ain&rsquo;t as sharp with
them as with wild beastesses, no man&rsquo;s life, nor the
ship&rsquo;s neither, would be worth a day&rsquo;s
purchase.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he, with his simple straightforward notions of right and
wrong worth, much maudlin unmerciful indulgence which we hear in
these days: and yet not going to the bottom of the matter either,
as we shall see in the next war.&nbsp; But, rambling on, he told
me how he had come home, war-worn and crippled, to marry a wife
and get tall sons, and lay his bones in his native village; till
which time (for death to the aged poor man is a Sabbath, of which
he talks freely, calmly, even joyously) &lsquo;he just got his
bread, by the squire&rsquo;s kindness, patching and mending at
the stone deer-fences.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I gave him something to buy tobacco, and watched him as he
crawled away, with a sort of stunned surprise.&nbsp; And he had
actually seen Nelson sit by Lady Hamilton!&nbsp; It was so
strange, to have that gay Italian bay, with all its
memories,&mdash;the orgies of Bai&aelig;, and the unburied wrecks
of ancient towns, with the smoking crater far above; and the
world-famous Nile-mouths and those great old wars, big with the
destinies of the world; and those great old heroes, with their
awful deeds for good and evil, all brought so suddenly and
livingly before me, up there in the desolate moorland, where the
deer, and birds, and heath, and rushes were even as they had been
from the beginning.&nbsp; Like Wordsworth with his Leech-Gatherer
(a poem which I, in spite of laughter, must rank among his very
highest),&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;While he was talking thus, the lonely
place,<br />
The old man&rsquo;s shape, and speech&mdash;all troubled me;<br
/>
In my mind&rsquo;s eye I seemed to see him pace<br />
About the weary moors continually,<br />
Wandering about alone and silently.<br />
. . . and when he ended,<br />
I could have laughed myself to scorn to find<br />
In that decrepit man so firm a mind.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Just then I heard a rustle, and turning, saw Claude toiling
down to me over the hill-side.&nbsp; He joined me, footsore and
weary, but in great excitement; for the first minute or two he
could not speak, and at last,&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, I have seen such a sight!&mdash;but I will tell you
how it all was.&nbsp; After I left you I met a keeper.&nbsp; He
spoke civilly to me&mdash;you know my antipathy to game and those
who live thereby: but there was a wild, bold, self-helping look
about him and his gun alone there in the waste&mdash;and after
all he was a man and a brother.&nbsp; Well, we fell into talk,
and fraternized; and at last he offered to take me to a
neighbouring hill and show me &ldquo;sixty head of red-deer all
together;&rdquo; and as he spoke he looked quite proud of his
words.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was lucky,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to come
just then, for the stags had all just got their heads
again.&rdquo;&nbsp; At which speech I wondered; but was silent,
and followed him, I, Claude the Cockney, such a walk as I shall
never take again.&nbsp; Behold these trousers&mdash;behold these
hands! scratched to pieces by crawling on all-fours through the
heather.&nbsp; But I saw them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;A sight worth many pairs of plaid trousers?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Worth Saint Chrysostom&rsquo;s seven years&rsquo;
nakedness on all-fours!&nbsp; And so I told the fellow, who by
some cunning calculations about wind, and sun, and so forth,
which he imparted to my uncomprehending ears, brought me suddenly
to the top of a little crag, below which, some hundred yards off,
the whole herd stood, stags, hinds&mdash;but I can&rsquo;t
describe them.&nbsp; I have not brought away a scrap of sketch,
though we watched them full ten minutes undiscovered; and then
the stare, and the toss of those antlers, and the rush!&nbsp;
That broke the spell with me; for I had been staring stupidly at
them, trying in vain to take in the sight, with the strangest new
excitement heaving and boiling up in my throat; and at the sound
of their hoofs on the turf I woke, and found the keeper staring,
not at them, but at me, who, I verily believe, had something very
like a tear in these excitable eyes of mine.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you well, sir?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t be afeard; it&rsquo;s only at the fall
of the year the stags is wicked.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I answered at first; but the
fellow understood me when I shook his hand frantically, and told
him that I should thank him to the last day of my life, and that
I would not have missed it for a thousand pounds.&nbsp; In
part-proof whereof I gave him a sovereign on the spot, which
seemed to clear my character in his eyes as much as the crying at
the sight of a herd of deer had mystified it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude, well-beloved,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;will you
ever speak contemptuously of sportsmen any more?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Do manus,&rdquo; I have been vilifying them, as
one does most things in the world, only for want of understanding
them.&nbsp; How shall I do penance?&nbsp; Go and take service
with Edwin Landseer, as pupil, colour-grinder,
footboy?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You will then be very near to a very great poet,&rsquo;
quoth I, &lsquo;and one whose works will become, as centuries
roll on, more and more valuable to art and to science, and,
possibly, to something higher than either.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I begin to guess your meaning,&rsquo; answered
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So we lounged, and dreamt, and fished, in heathery
Highland,&rsquo; as Mr. Clough would say, while the summer snipes
flitted whistling up the shallow before us, and the soft,
south-eastern clouds slid lazily across the sun, and the little
trout snapped and dimpled at a tiny partridge hackle, with a
twist of orange silk, whose elegance for shape and colour
reconciled Claude&rsquo;s heart somewhat to my everlasting
whipping of the water.&nbsp; When as last:&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You seem to have given up catching anything.&nbsp; You
have not stirred a fish in this last two pools, except that
little saucy yellow shrimp, who jumped over your fly, and gave a
spiteful slap at it with his tail.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Too true; and what could be the cause?&nbsp; Had that impudent
sand-piper frightened all the fish on his way up?&nbsp; Had an
otter paralysed them with terror for the morning?&nbsp; Or had a
stag been down to drink?&nbsp; We saw the fresh slot of his broad
claws, by the bye, in the mud a few yards back.</p>
<p>&lsquo;We must have seen the stag himself, if he had been here
lately,&rsquo; said Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Landseer knows too well by this time that that is a
non sequitur.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;I am no more a non sequitur than you are,&rdquo;
answered the Cornish magistrate to the barrister.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Fish and deer, friend, see us purblind sons of men
somewhat more quickly than we see them, fear sharpening the
senses.&nbsp; Perhaps, after all, the fault is in your staring
white-straw hat, a garment which has spoilt many a good
day&rsquo;s fishing.&nbsp; Ah, no! there is the cause; the hat of
a mightier than you&mdash;the thunder-spirit himself.&nbsp; Thor
is at hand, while the breeze, awe-stricken, falls dead calm
before his march.&nbsp; Behold, climbing above that eastern
ridge, his huge powdered cauliflower-wig, barred with a grey
horizontal handkerchief of mist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, profane and uncomely simile!&mdash;which will next,
I presume, liken the coming hailstorm to hair-powder shaken from
the said wig.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;To shot rather than to powder.&nbsp; Flee, oh, flee to
yonder pile of crags, and thank your stars that there is one at
hand; for these mountain tornadoes are at once Tropic in their
ferocity and Siberian in their cutting cold.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Down it came.&nbsp; The brown hills vanished in white sheets
of hail, first falling perpendicularly, then slanting and driving
furiously before the cold blast which issued from the
storm.&nbsp; The rock above us rang with the thunder-peals; and
the lightning, which might have fallen miles away, seemed to our
dazzled eyes to dive into the glittering river at our feet.&nbsp;
We sat silent some half-hour, listening to the voice of One more
mighty than ourselves; and it was long after the uproar had
rolled away among the hills, and a steady, sighing sheet of
warmer rains, from banks of low grey fog, had succeeded the
rattling of the hail upon the crisp heather, that I turned to
Claude.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now, since your heart is softened towards these
wild, stag-hunting, trout fishing, jovial west-countrymen,
consider whether it should not be softened likewise toward those
old outlaw ballads which I have never yet been able to make you
admire.&nbsp; They express feelings not yet extinct in the minds
of a large portion of the lower orders, as you would know had you
lived, like me, all your life in poaching counties, and on the
edges of one forest after another,&mdash;feelings which must be
satisfied, even in the highest development of the civilization of
the future, for they are innate in every thoughtful and energetic
race,&mdash;feelings which, though they have often led to crime,
have far oftener delivered from swinish sensuality; the feelings
which drove into the merry greenwood &ldquo;Robin Hood, Scarlet,
and John;&rdquo; &ldquo;Adam Bell, and Clym of the Cleugh, and
William of Cloudislee;&rdquo; the feelings which prompted one
half of his inspiration to the nameless immortal who wrote the
&ldquo;Nutbrown Maid;&rdquo;&mdash;feelings which could not then,
and cannot now, be satisfied by the drudgery of a barbaric
agriculture, which, without science, economy, or enterprise,
offers no food for the highest instincts of the human mind, its
yearnings after Nature, after freedom, and the noble excitement
of self-dependent energy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Our talk ended: but the rain did not: and we were at last fain
to leave our shelter, and let ourselves be blown by the gale (the
difficulty being not to progress forward, but to keep our feet)
back to the shed where our ponies were tied, and to canter home
to Lynmouth, with the rain cutting our faces like showers of
pebbles, and our little mountain ponies staggering against the
wind, and more than once, if Londoners will believe me, blown
sheer up against the bank by some mad gust, which rushed
perpendicularly, not down, but up, the chasms of the glens
below.</p>
<h3>II.&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Coast Line</span>.</h3>
<p>It is four o&rsquo;clock on a May morning, and Claude and I
are just embarking on board a Clovelly trawling skiff, which,
having disposed of her fish at various ports along the Channel,
is about to run leisurely homewards with an ebb tide, and a soft
north-easterly breeze.</p>
<p>So farewell, fair Lynmouth; and ye storm-spirits, send us a
propitious day; and dismiss those fantastic clouds which are
coquetting with your thrones, crawling down one hill-side, and
whirling and leaping up another, in wreaths of snow, and dun, and
amber, pierced every minute by some long glittering upward arrow
from the rising sun, which gilds grey crags and downs a thousand
feet above, while underneath the gorges still sleep black and
cold in shade.</p>
<p>There, they have heard us!&nbsp; The cap rises off the
&lsquo;Summer-house hill,&rsquo; that eight hundred feet of
upright wall, which seems ready to topple down into the nest of
be-myrtled cottages at its foot; and as we sweep out into the
deeper water the last mist-flake streams up from the Foreland,
and vanishes in white threads into the stainless blue.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at the colours of that Foreland!&rsquo; cried
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;The simple monotone of pearly green, broken
only at intervals by blood-red stains, where the turf has slipped
and left the fresh rock bare, and all glimmering softly through a
delicate blue haze, like the bloom on a half-ripened
plum!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And look, too, how the grey pebble beach is already
dancing and quivering in the mirage which steams up, like the hot
breath of a limekiln, from the drying stones.&nbsp; Talk of
&ldquo;glazings and scumblings,&rdquo; ye artists! and bungle at
them as you will, what are they to Nature&rsquo;s own glazings,
deepening every instant there behind us?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mock me not.&nbsp; I have walked up and down here with
a humbled and broken spirit, and had nearly forsworn the audacity
of painting anything beyond a beech stem, or a frond of
fern.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The little infinite in them would have baffled you as
much as the only somewhat bigger infinite of just the hills on
which they grow.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Confest: and so farewell to unpaintable Lynmouth!&nbsp;
Farewell to the charming contrast of civilized English
landscape-gardening, with its villas, and its exotics, and its
evergreens, thus strangely and yet harmoniously confronted with
the chaos of the rocks and mountain-streams.&nbsp; Those grounds
of Sir William H&mdash;&rsquo;s are a double paradise, the wild
Eden of the Past side by side with the cultivated Eden of the
Future.&nbsp; How its alternations of Art and Savagery at once
startle and relieve the sense, as you pass suddenly out of
wildernesses of piled boulders, and torrent-shattered trees, and
the roar of fern-fringed waterfalls, into &ldquo;trim walks, and
fragrant alleys green;&rdquo; and the door of a summer-house
transports you at a step from Richmond to the Alps.&nbsp; Happy
he who &ldquo;possesses,&rdquo; as the world calls it, and
happier still he whose taste could organize, that fairy
bower.&rsquo;</p>
<p>So he, magniloquently, as was his wont; and yet his
declamations always flowed with such a graceful ease,&mdash;a
simple, smiling earnestness,&mdash;an unpractised melody of
voice, that what would have been rant from other lips, from his
showed only as the healthy enthusiasm of the passionate,
all-seeing, all-loving artist.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look yonder, again,&rsquo; said he, gazing up at the
huge boulder-strewn hill-side above us.&nbsp; &lsquo;One wonders
at that sight, whether the fable of the giants be not true after
all,&mdash;and that &ldquo;Vale of Rocks,&rdquo; hanging five
hundred feet in air, with all its crag-castles, and tottering
battlements, and colossal crumbling idols, and great blocks,
which hang sloping, caught in act to fall, be not some enormous
Cyclopean temple left half-disinterred: or is it a fragment of
old Chaos, left unorganized?&mdash;or, perhaps, the waste heap of
the world, where, after the rest of England had been made, some
angel put up a notice for his fellows, &ldquo;Dry rubbish shot
here&rdquo;?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not so, unscientific!&nbsp; It is the grandfather of
hills,&mdash;a fossil bone of some old continent, which stood
here ages before England was.&nbsp; And the great earth-angel,
who grinds up mountains into paint, as you do bits of ochre, for
his &ldquo;Continental Sketches,&rdquo; found in it the materials
for a whole dark ground-tone of coal-measures, and a few hundred
miles of warm high-lights, which we call New Red
Sandstone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>What a sea-wall they are, those Exmoor hills!&nbsp; Sheer
upward from the sea a thousand feet rise the downs; and as we
slide and stagger lazily along before the dying breeze, through
the deep water which never leaves the cliff, the eye ranges,
almost dizzy, up some five hundred feet of rock, dappled with
every hue; from the intense dark of the tide-line, through the
warm green and brown rock-shadows, out of which the horizontal
cracks of the strata loom black, and the breeding gulls show like
lingering snow-flakes; up to the middle cliff, where delicate
grey fades into pink, pink into red, red into glowing purple; up
to where the purple is streaked with glossy ivy wreaths, and
black-green yews; up to where all the choir of colours vanishes
abruptly on the mid-hill, to give place to one yellowish-grey
sheet of upward down, sweeping aloft smooth and unbroken, except
by a lonely stone, or knot of clambering sheep, and stopped by
one great rounded waving line, sharp-cut against the brilliant
blue.&nbsp; The sheep hang like white daisies upon the steep; and
a solitary falcon rides, a speck in air, yet far below the crest
of that tall hill.&nbsp; Now he sinks to the cliff edge, and
hangs quivering, supported, like a kite, by the pressure of his
breast and long curved wings, against the breeze.</p>
<p>There he hangs, the peregrine&mdash;a true &lsquo;falcon
gentle,&rsquo; &lsquo;sharp-notched, long-taloned,
crooked-winged,&rsquo; whose uncles and cousins, ages since, have
struck at duck and pheasant, and sat upon the wrists of
kings.&nbsp; And now he is full proud of any mouse or cliff-lark;
like an old Chingachgook, last of the Mohicans, he lingers round
&lsquo;the hunting-field of his fathers.&rsquo;&nbsp; So all
things end.</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;The old order changeth, giving place to the
new;<br />
And God fulfils Himself in many ways,<br />
Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, and the day may come,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;when the brows of that huge High Vere shall be crowned
with golden wheat, and every rock-ledge on Trentishoe, like those
of Petra and the Rhine, support its garden-bed of artificial
soil.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And when,&rsquo; I answered, &lsquo;the shingly sides
of that great chasm of Headon&rsquo;s Mouth may be clothed with
the white mulberry, and the summer limestone-skiffs shall go back
freighted with fabrics which vie with the finest woof of Italy
and Lyons.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You believe, then, in the late Mrs. Whitby of
Lymington?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Seeing is believing, Claude: through laughter, and
failures, and the stupidity of half-barbarous clods, she
persevered in her silk-growing, and succeeded; and I should like
to put her book into the hands of every squire in Devon,
Cornwall, and the South of Ireland.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Or require them to pass an examination in it, as one
more among the many books which I intend, in my ideal kingdom,
all landlords to read and digest, before they are allowed to take
possession of their estates.&nbsp; In the meantime, what is that
noble conical hill, which has increased my wonder at the infinite
variety of beauty which The Spirit can produce by combinations so
simple as a few grey stones and a sheet of turf?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The Hangman.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;An ominous name.&nbsp; What is its history?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Some sheep-stealer, they say, clambering over a wall
with his booty slung round his neck, was literally hung by the
poor brute&rsquo;s struggles, and found days after on the
mountain-side, a blackened corpse on one side of the wall, with
the sheep on the other, and the ravens&mdash;You may fill up the
picture for yourself.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, see, as we round the Hangman, what a change of
scene&mdash;the square-blocked sandstone cliffs dip suddenly
under dark slate-beds, fantastically bent and broken by primeval
earthquakes.&nbsp; Wooded combes, and craggy ridges of rich
pasture-land, wander and slope towards a labyrinth of
bush-fringed coves, black isolated tide-rocks, and land-locked
harbours.&nbsp; There shines among the woods the Castle of
Watermouth, on its lovely little salt-water loch, the safest
harbour on the coast; and there is Combe-Martin, mile-long
man-stye, which seven centuries of fruitless silver-mining, and
of the right (now deservedly lost) of &lsquo;sending a talker to
the national palaver,&rsquo; have neither cleansed nor
civilized.&nbsp; Turn, turn thy head away, dear Claude, lest even
at this distance some foul odour taint the summer airs, and
complete the misfortune already presaged by that pale, sad face,
sickening in the burning calm!&nbsp; For this great sun-roasted
fire-brick of the Exmoor range is fairly burning up the breeze,
and we have nothing but the tide to drift us slowly down to
Ilfracombe.</p>
<p>Now we open Rillage, and now Hillsborough, two of the most
picturesque of headlands; see how their round foreheads of
glistening grey shale sink down into two dark, jagged moles,
running far out to seaward, and tapering off, each into a long
black horizontal line, vanishing at last beneath its lace-fringe
of restless hissing foam.&nbsp; How grand the contrast of the
lightness of those sea-lines, with the solid mass which rests
upon them!&nbsp; Look, too, at the glaring lights and Tartarean
shadows of those chasms and caves, which the tide never leaves,
or the foot of man explores; and listen how, at every rush of the
long ground-swell, mysterious mutterings, solemn sighs, sudden
thunders, as of a pent-up earthquake, boom out of them across the
glassy swell.&nbsp; Look at those blasts of delicate vapour that
shoot up from hidden rifts, and hang a moment, and vanish; and
those green columns of wave which rush mast-high up the
perpendicular walls, and then fall back and outward in a
waterfall of foam, lacing the black rocks with a thousand snowy
streams.&nbsp; There they fall, and leap, and fall again.&nbsp;
And so they did yesterday, and the day before; and so they did
centuries ago, when the Danes swept past them, battleworn, and
sad of heart for the loss of the magic raven flag, from the fight
at Appledore, to sit down and starve on &lsquo;the island of
Bradanrelice, which men call Flat Holms.&rsquo;&nbsp; Ay, and
even so they leapt and fell, before a sail gleamed on the Severn
sea, when the shark and the ichthyosaur paddled beneath the shade
of tropic forests&mdash;now scanty turf and golden gorse.&nbsp;
And so they will leap and fall on, on, through the centuries and
the ages.&nbsp; O dim abyss of Time, into which we peer
shuddering, what will be the end of thee, and of this ceaseless
coil and moan of waters?&nbsp; It is true, that when thou shalt
be no more, then, too, &lsquo;there shall be no more sea;&rsquo;
and this ocean bed, this great grave of fertility, into which all
earth&rsquo;s wasted riches stream, day and night, from hill and
town, shall rise and become fruitful soil, corn-field and
meadow-land; and earth shall teem as thick with living men as
bean-fields with the summer bees?&nbsp; What a
consummation!&nbsp; At least there is One greater than sea, or
time: and the Judge of all the earth will do right.</p>
<p>But there is Ilfracombe, with its rock-walled harbour, its
little wood of masts within, its white terraces, rambling up the
hills, and its capstone sea-walk, the finest &lsquo;marine
parade,&rsquo; as Cockneydom terms it, in all England, except
that splendid Hoe at Plymouth, &lsquo;Lam Goemagot,&rsquo;
Gog-magog&rsquo;s leap, as the old Britains called it, over which
Corineus threw that mighty giant.&nbsp; And there is the little
isolated rock-chapel, where seven hundred years ago, our
west-country forefathers used to go to pray St. Nicholas for
deliverance from shipwreck,&mdash;a method lovingly regretted by
some, as a &lsquo;pious idea of the Ages of faith.&rsquo;&nbsp;
We, however, shall prefer the method of lighthouses and the
worthy Trinity Board, as actually more godly and
&lsquo;faithful,&rsquo; as well as more useful; and, probably, so
do the sailors themselves.</p>
<p>But Claude is by this time nearly sick of the roasting calm,
and the rolling ground-swell, and the smell of fish, and is
somewhat sleepy also, between early rising and incoherent
sermons; wherefore, if he takes good advice, he will stay and
recruit himself at Ilfracombe, before he proceeds further with
his self-elected cicerone on the grand tour of North Devon.&nbsp;
Believe me, Claude, you will not stir from the place for a month
at least.&nbsp; For be sure, if you are sea-sick, or heart-sick,
or pocket-sick either, there is no pleasanter or cheaper place of
cure (to indulge in a puff of a species now well nigh obsolete,
the puff honest and true) than this same Ilfracombe, with its
quiet nature and its quiet luxury, its rock fairyland and its
sea-walks, its downs and combes, its kind people, and, if
possible, its still kinder climate, which combines the soft
warmth of South Devon with the bracing freshness of the Welsh
mountains; where winter has slipped out of the list of the
seasons, and mother Earth makes up for her summer&rsquo;s luxury
by fasting, &lsquo;not in sackcloth and ashes, but in new silk
and old sack;&rsquo; and instead of standing three months
chin-deep in ice, and christening great snowballs her
&lsquo;friends and family,&rsquo; as St. Francis of Assisi did of
old, knows no severer asceticism than tepid shower-baths, and a
parasol of soft grey mist.</p>
<h3>III.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Morte</span>.</h3>
<p>I had been wandering over the centre of Exmoor, killing trout
as I went, through a country which owes its civilization and
tillage to the spirit of one man, who has found stag-preserving
by no means incompatible with large agricultural improvements;
among a population who still evince an unpleasant partiality for
cutting and carrying farmers&rsquo; crops by night, without leave
or licence, and for housebreaking after the true classic method
of Athens, by fairly digging holes through the house walls; a
little nook of primeval savagery fast reorganizing itself under
the influences of these better days.&nbsp; I had been on
Dartmoor, too; but of that noble moorland range so much has been
said and sung of late, that I really am afraid it is becoming
somewhat cockney and trite.&nbsp; Far and wide I had wandered,
rod in hand, becoming a boy again in the land of my boyhood,
till, once more at Ilfracombe, opposite me sat Claude Mellot,
just beginning to bloom again into cheerfulness.</p>
<p>We were on the point of starting for Morte, and so round to
Saunton Court, and the sands beyond it; where a Clovelly trawler,
which we had chartered for the occasion, had promised to send a
boat on shore and take us off, provided the wind lay off the
land.</p>
<p>But, indeed, the sea was calm as glass, the sky cloudless
azure; and the doubt was not whether we should be able to get on
board through the surf, but whether, having got on board, we
should not lie till nightfall, as idle</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;As a painted ship,<br />
Upon a painted ocean.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And now behold us on our way up lovely combes, with their
green copses, ridges of rock, golden furze, fruit-laden orchards,
and slopes of emerald pasture, pitched as steep as house-roofs,
where the red longhorns are feeding, with their tails a yard
above their heads; and under us, seen in bird&rsquo;s-eye view,
the ground-plans of the little snug farms and homesteads of the
Damnonii, &lsquo;dwellers in the valley,&rsquo; as we
West-countrymen were called of old.&nbsp; Now we are leaving them
far below us; the blue hazy sea is showing far above the serrated
ridge of the Tors, and their huge bank of sunny green: and before
us is a desolate table-land of rushy pastures and mouldering
banks, festooned with the delicate network of the little
ivy-leaved campanula, loveliest of British wild-flowers, fit with
its hair-like stems and tiny bells of blue to wreathe the temples
of Titania.&nbsp; Alas! we have passed out of the world into
limbum patrum, and the region of ineffectuality and
incompleteness.&nbsp; The only cultivators here, and through
thousands of acres in the North of Devon, are the rook and mole:
and yet the land is rich enough&mdash;the fat deep crumbling of
the shale and ironstone returning year by year into the mud, from
whence it hardened ages since.&nbsp; There are scores of farms of
far worse land in mid-England, under &lsquo;a four-course
shift,&rsquo; yielding their load of wheat an acre.&nbsp; When
will that land do as much?&nbsp; When will the spirit of Smith of
Deanston and Grey of Dilston descend on North Devon?&nbsp; When
will some true captain of industry, and Theseus of the nineteenth
century, like the late Mr. Warnes of Trimmingham, teach the
people here to annihilate poor-rates by growing flax upon some of
the finest flax land, and in the finest flax climate, that we
have in England?&nbsp; The shrewd Cornishmen of Launceston and
Bodmin have awakened long ago to &lsquo;the new gospel of
fertility.&rsquo;&nbsp; When will North Devon awake?</p>
<p>&lsquo;When landlords and farmers,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;at last acknowledge their divine vocation, and feel it a
noble and heaven-ordained duty to produce food for the people of
England; when they learn that to grow rushes where they might
grow corn, ay, to grow four quarters of wheat where they might
grow five, is to sin against God&rsquo;s blessings and against
the English nation.&nbsp; No wonder that sluggards like these cry
out for protection&mdash;that those who cannot take care of the
land feel that they themselves need artificial care.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;We will not talk politics, Claude.&nbsp; Our modern
expediency mongers have made them <i>pro tempore</i> an extinct
science.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the dead bury their dead.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The social questions are now-a-days becoming far more important
than the mere House of Commons ones.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;There does seem here and there,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;some sign of improvement.&nbsp; I see the paring plough at
work on one field and another.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Swiftly goes the age, and slowly crawls
improvement.&nbsp; The greater part of that land will be only
broken up to be exhausted by corn-crop after corn-crop, till it
can bear no more, and the very manure which is drawn home from it
in the shape of a few turnips will be wasted by every rain of
heaven, and the straw probably used to mend bad places in the
road with; while the land returns to twenty years of worse
sterility than ever; on the ground that&mdash;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Veather did zo, and gramfer did zo, and why
shouldn&rsquo;t Jan do the zame?&rdquo;&rsquo; * * * *</p>
<p>&lsquo;But here is Morte below us.&nbsp; &ldquo;The little
grey church on the windy shore,&rdquo; which once belonged to
William de Tracy, one of your friend Thomas &agrave;
Becket&rsquo;s murderers.&nbsp; If you wish to vent your wrath
against those who cut off your favourite Saxon hero, there is a
tomb in the church which bears De Tracy&rsquo;s name; over which
rival Dryasdusts contend fiercely with paper-arrows: the one
party asserting that he became a priest, and died here in the
wilderness; the others that the tomb is of later date, that he
fled hence to Italy, under favour of a certain easy-going Bishop
of Exeter, and died penitent and duly shriven, according to the
attestations of a certain or uncertain Bishop of
Cosenza.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Peace be with him and with the Bishop!&nbsp; The flight
to Italy seems a very needless precaution to a man who owned this
corner of the world.&nbsp; A bailiff would have had even less
chance here then than in Connemara a hundred years
ago.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;He certainly would have fed the crabs and rock-cod in
two hours after his arrival.&nbsp; Nevertheless, I believe the
Cosenza story is the safer one.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a chaos of rock-ridges!&mdash;Old starved mother
Earth&rsquo;s bare-worn ribs and joints peeping out through every
field and down; and on three sides of us, the sullen thunder of
the unseen surge.&nbsp; What a place for some
&ldquo;gloom-pampered man&rdquo; to sit and
misanthropize!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Morte,&rdquo; says the Devonshire proverb,
&ldquo;is the place on earth which heaven made last, and the
devil will take first.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;All the fitter for a misanthrope.&nbsp; But where are
the trees?&nbsp; I have not seen one for the last four
miles.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Nor will you for a few miles more.&nbsp; Whatever will
grow here (and most things will) they will not, except, at least,
hereafter the sea-pine of the Biscay shore.&nbsp; You would know
why, if you had ever felt a south-westerly gale here, when the
foam-flakes are flying miles inland, and you are fain to cling
breathless to bank and bush, if you want to get one look at those
black fields of shark&rsquo;s-tooth tide-rocks, champing and
churning the great green rollers into snow.&nbsp; Wild folk are
these here, gatherers of shell-fish and laver, and merciless to
wrecked vessels, which they consider as their own by immemorial
usage, or rather right divine.&nbsp; Significant, how an
agricultural people is generally as cruel to wrecked seamen, as a
fishing one is merciful.&nbsp; I could tell you twenty stories of
the baysmen down there to the westward risking themselves like
very heroes to save strangers&rsquo; lives, and beating off the
labouring folk who swarmed down for plunder from the inland
hills.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Knowledge, you see, breeds sympathy and love.&nbsp; But
what a merciless coast!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Hardly a winter passes without a wreck or two.&nbsp;
You see there lying about the timbers of more than one tall
ship.&nbsp; You see, too, that black rock a-wash far out at sea,
apparently a submarine outlier of the north horn of this wide
rock-amphitheatre below us.&nbsp; That is the Morte stone, the
&ldquo;Death-rock,&rdquo; as the Normans christened it of old;
and it does not belie its name even now.&nbsp; See how, even in
this calm, it hurls up its column of spray at every wave; and
then conceive being entrapped between it and the cliffs, on some
blinding, whirling winter&rsquo;s night, when the land is
shrouded thick in clouds, and the roar of the breakers hardly
precedes by a minute the crash of your bows against the
rocks.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I never think, on principle, of things so painful, and
yet so irrelievable.&nbsp; Yet why does not your much-admired
Trinity House erect a light there?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;So ask the sailors; for it is indeed one of the
gateway-jambs of the Channel, and the deep water and the line of
coast tempt all craft to pass as close to it as
possible.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Look at that sheet of yellow sand below us now, banked
to the inland with sand-hills and sunny downs, and ending
abruptly at the foot of that sombre wall of slate-hill, which
runs out like a huge pier into the sea some two miles
off.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is Woollacombe: but here on our right is a sight
worth seeing.&nbsp; Every gully and creek there among the rocks
is yellow, but not with sand.&nbsp; Those are shells; the
sweepings of the ocean bed for miles around, piled there,
millions upon millions, yards deep, in every stage of
destruction.&nbsp; There they lie grinding to dust; and every
gale brings in fresh myriads from the inexhaustible sea-world, as
if Death could be never tired of devouring, or God of
making.&nbsp; The brain grows dizzy and tired, as one&rsquo;s
feet crunch over the endless variety of their forms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And then one recollects that every one of them has been
a living thing&mdash;a whole history of birth, and growth, and
propagation, and death.&nbsp; Waste it cannot be, or cruelty on
the part of the Maker: but why this infinite development of life,
apparently only to furnish out of it now and then a cartload of
shell-sand to these lazy farmers?&nbsp; But after all, there is
not so much life in all those shells put together as in one
little child: and it may die the hour that it is born!&nbsp; What
we call life is but an appearance and a becoming; the true life
of existence belongs only to spirits.&nbsp; And whether or not
we, or the sea-shell there, are at any given moment helping to
make up part of some pretty little pattern in this great
kaleidoscope called the material universe, yet, in the spirit all
live to Him, and shall do so for ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And thereon he rambled off into a long lecture on
&lsquo;species-spirits,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;individual-spirits,&rsquo; and &lsquo;personal
spirits,&rsquo; doubtless most important.&nbsp; But I, what
between the sun, the luncheon, and the metaphysic, sank into soft
slumbers, from which I was only awakened by the carriage
stopping, according to our order, on the top of Saunton hill.</p>
<p>We left the fly, and wandered down towards the old gabled
court, nestling amid huge walnuts in its southward glen; while
before us spread a panorama, half sea, half land, than which,
perhaps, our England owns few lovelier.</p>
<p>At our feet was a sea of sand&mdash;for the half-mile to the
right smooth as a floor, bounded by a broad band of curling
waves, which crept slowly shorewards with the advancing
tide.&nbsp; Right underneath us the sand was drifted for miles
into fantastic hills, which quivered in the heat, the glaring
yellow of its lights chequered by delicate pink shadows and
sheets of grey-green bent.&nbsp; To the left were rich alluvial
marshes, covered with red cattle sleeping in the sun, and laced
with creeks and flowery dykes; and here and there a scarlet line,
which gladdened Claude&rsquo;s eye as being a &lsquo;bit of
positive colour in the foreground,&rsquo; and mine, because they
were draining tiles.&nbsp; Beyond again, two broad tide-rivers,
spotted with white and red-brown sails, gleamed like avenues of
silver, past knots of gay dwellings, and tall lighthouses, and
church-towers, and wandered each on its own road, till they
vanished among the wooded hills.&nbsp; On the eastern horizon the
dark range of Exmoor sank gradually into lower and more broken
ridges, which rolled away, woodland beyond woodland, till all
outlines were lost in purple haze; while, far beyond, the granite
peaks of Dartmoor hung like a delicate blue cloud, and enticed
the eye away into infinity.&nbsp; From hence, as our eyes swept
round the horizon, the broken hills above the river&rsquo;s mouth
gradually rose into the table-land of the &lsquo;barren
coal-measures&rsquo; some ten miles off,&mdash;a long straight
wall of cliffs which hounded the broad bay, buried in deepest
shadow, except where the opening of some glen revealed far depths
of sunlit wood.&nbsp; A faint perpendicular line of white houses,
midway along the range, marked our destination; and far to the
westward, the land ended sheer and suddenly at the cliffs of
Hartland, the &lsquo;Promontory of Hercules,&rsquo; as the old
Romans called it, to reappear some ten miles out in the Atlantic,
in the blue flat-topped island of Lundy, so exactly similar in
height and form to the opposite cape, that it required no
scientific imagination to supply the vast gap which the primeval
currents had sawn out.&nbsp; There it all lay beneath us like a
map; its thousand hues toned down harmoniously into each other by
the summer haze, and &lsquo;the eye was not filled with
seeing,&rsquo; nor the spirit with the intoxicating sight of
infinitely various life and form in perfectest repose.</p>
<p>I was the first to break the silence.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Claude, well-beloved, will you not sketch a
little?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not even rhapsodize? call it &ldquo;lovely, exquisite,
grand, majestic&rdquo;?&nbsp; There are plenty of such words in
worldlings&rsquo; mouths&mdash;not a Cockney but would burst out
with some enthusiastic commonplace at such a sight&mdash;surely
one or other of them must be appropriate.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Silence, profane! and take me away from this.&nbsp; Let
us go down, and hide our stupidities among those sand-hills, and
so forget the whole.&nbsp; What use standing here to be maddened
by this tantalizing earth-spirit, who shows us such glorious
things, and will not tell us what they mean?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So down we went upon the burrows, among the sands, which hid
from us every object but their own chaotic curves and
mounds.&nbsp; Above, a hundred skylarks made the air ring with
carollings; strange and gaudy plants flecked the waste round us;
and insects without number whirred over our heads, or hung poised
with their wings outspread on the tall stalks of marram
grass.&nbsp; All at once a cloud hid the sun, and a summer
whirlwind, presage of the thunderstorm, swept past us, carrying
up with it a column of dry sand, and rattling the dry bents over
our heads.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What a chill, doleful sigh comes from those
reeds!&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I can conceive this
desert, beneath a driving winter&rsquo;s sky instead of this
burning azure, one of the most desolate places on the
earth.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, desolate enough,&rsquo; I said, as we walked down
beyond the tide-mark, over the vast fields of ribbed and splashy
sands, &lsquo;when the dead shells are rolling and crawling up
the beach in wreaths before the gale, with a ghastly rattle as of
the dry bones in the &ldquo;Valley of Vision,&rdquo; and when not
a flower shows on that sandcliff, which is now one broad bed of
yellow, scarlet, and azure.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;That is the first spot in England,&rsquo; said Claude,
&lsquo;except, of course, &ldquo;the meads of golden
king-cups,&rdquo; where I have seen wild flowers give a tone to
the colouring of the whole landscape, as they are said to do in
the prairies of Texas.&nbsp; And look how flowers and cliff are
both glowing in a warm green haze, like that of Cuyp&rsquo;s
wonderful sandcliff picture in the Dulwich
Gallery,&mdash;wonderful, as I think, and true, let some critics
revile it as much as they will.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Strange, that you should have quoted that picture here;
its curious resemblance to this very place first awoke in me,
years ago, a living interest in landscape-painting.&nbsp; But
look there; even in these grand summer days there is a sight
before us sad enough.&nbsp; There are the ribs of some ill-fated
ship, a man-of-war too, as the story goes, standing like black
fangs, half-buried in the sand.&nbsp; And off what are those two
ravens rising, stirring up with their obscene wings a sickly,
putrescent odour?&nbsp; A corpse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>No, it was not a corpse; but the token of many corpses.&nbsp;
A fragment of some ship; its gay green paint and half-effaced
gilding contrasting mockingly with the long ugly feathered
barnacle-shells, which clustered on it, rotting into slime
beneath the sun, and torn and scattered by the greedy beaks of
the ravens.</p>
<p>In what tropic tornado, or on what coral-key of the Bahamas,
months ago, to judge by those barnacles, had that tall ship gone
down?&nbsp; How long had that scrap of wreck gone wandering down
the Gulf Stream, from Newfoundland into the Mid-Atlantic, and
hitherward on its homeless voyage toward the Spitzbergen
shore?&nbsp; And who were all those living men who &ldquo;went
down to Hades, even many stalwart souls of heroes,&rdquo; to give
no sign until the sea shall render up her dead?&nbsp; And every
one of them had a father and mother&mdash;a wife, perhaps, and
children, waiting for him&mdash;at least a whole human life,
childhood, boyhood, manhood, in him.&nbsp; All those years of
toil and education, to get him so far on his life-voyage; and
here is the end thereof!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Say rather, the beginning thereof,&rsquo; Claude
answered, stepping into the boat.&nbsp; &lsquo;This wreck is but
a torn scrap of the chrysalis-cocoon; we may meet the butterflies
themselves hereafter.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>And now we are on board; and alas! some time before the breeze
will be so.&nbsp; Take care of that huge boom, landsman Claude,
swaying and sweeping backwards and forwards across the deck,
unless you wish to be knocked overboard.&nbsp; Take care, too, of
that loose rope&rsquo;s end, unless you wish to have your eyes
cut out.&nbsp; Take my advice, lie down here across the deck, as
others are doing.&nbsp; Cover yourself with great-coats, like an
Irishman, to keep yourself cool, and let us meditate little on
this strange thing, and strange place, which holds us now.</p>
<p>Look at those spars, how they creak and groan with every heave
of the long glassy swell.&nbsp; How those sails flap, and
thunder, and rage, with useless outcries and struggles&mdash;only
because they are idle.&nbsp; Let the wind take them, and they
will be steady, silent in an instant&mdash;their deafening
dissonant grumbling exchanged for the soft victorious song of the
breeze through the rigging, musical, self-contented, as of bird
on bough.&nbsp; So it is through life; there is no true rest but
labour.&nbsp; &ldquo;No true misery,&rdquo; as Carlyle says,
&ldquo;but in that of not being able to work.&rdquo;&nbsp; Some
may call it a pretty conceit.&nbsp; I call it a great worldwide
law, which reaches from earth to heaven.&nbsp; Whatever the
Preacher may have thought it in a moment of despondency, what is
it but a blessing that &ldquo;sun, and wind, and rivers, and
ocean,&rdquo; as he says, and &ldquo;all things, are full of
labour&mdash;man cannot utter it.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sea which
bears us would rot and poison, did it not sweep in and out here
twice a day in swift refreshing current; nay, more, in the very
water which laps against our bows troops of negro girls may have
hunted the purblind shark in West Indian harbours, beneath
glaring white-walled towns, with their rows of green jalousies,
and cocoa-nuts, and shaddock groves.&nbsp; For on those white
sands there to the left, year by year, are washed up foreign
canes, cassia beans, and tropic seeds; and sometimes, too, the
tropic ocean snails, with their fragile shells of amethystine
blue, come floating in mysteriously in fleets from the far west
out of the passing Gulf Stream, where they have been sailing out
their little life, never touching shore or ground, but buoyed
each by his cluster of air-bubbles, pumped in at will under the
skin of his tiny foot, by some cunning machinery of
valves&mdash;small creatures truly, but very wonderful to men who
have learned to reverence not merely the size of things, but the
wisdom of their idea, and raising strange longings and dreams
about that submarine ocean-world which stretches, teeming with
richer life than this terrestrial one, away, away there westward,
down the path of the sun, toward the future centre of the
world&rsquo;s destiny.</p>
<p>Wonderful ocean-world! three-fifths of our planet!&nbsp; Can
it be true that no rational beings are denizens there?&nbsp;
Science is severely silent&mdash;having as yet seen no mermaids:
our captain there forward is not silent&mdash;if he has not seen
them, plenty of his friends have.&nbsp; The young man here has
been just telling me that it was only last month one followed a
West Indiaman right across the Atlantic.&nbsp; &ldquo;For,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;there must be mermaids, and such like.&nbsp; Do
you think Heaven would have made all that water there only for
the herrings and mackerel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not know, Tom: but I, too, suspect not; and I do know
that honest men&rsquo;s guesses are sometimes found by science to
have been prophecies, and that there is no smoke without fire,
and few universal legends without their nucleus of fact.&nbsp;
After all, those sea-ladies are too lovely a dream to part with
in a hurry, at the mere despotic fiat of stern old Dame Analysis,
divine and reverend as she is.&nbsp; Why, like Keats&rsquo;s
Lamia,</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;Must
all charms flee,<br />
At the mere touch of cold Philosophy,&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>who will not even condescend to be awe-struck at the new
wonders which she herself reveals daily?&nbsp; Perhaps, too,
according to the Duke of Wellington&rsquo;s great dictum, that
each man must be the best judge in his own profession, sailors
may know best whether mermaids exist or not.&nbsp; Besides, was
it not here on Croyde Sands abreast of us, this very last summer,
that a maiden&mdash;by which beautiful old word West-country
people still call young girls&mdash;was followed up the shore by
a mermaid who issued from the breakers, green-haired,
golden-combed, and all; and, fleeing home, took to her bed and
died, poor thing, of sheer terror in the course of a few days,
persisting in her account of the monster?&nbsp; True, the mermaid
may have been an overgrown Lundy Island seal, carried out of his
usual haunts by spring-tides and a school of fish.&nbsp; Be it
so.&nbsp; Lundy and its seals are wonderful enough in all reason
to thinking men, as it looms up there out of the Atlantic, with
its two great square headlands, not twenty miles from us, in the
white summer haze.&nbsp; We will go there some day, and pick up a
wild tale or two about it.</p>
<p>But, lo! a black line creeps up the western horizon.&nbsp;
Tom, gesticulating, swears that he sees &lsquo;a billow
break.&rsquo;&nbsp; True: there they come; the great white
horses, that &lsquo;champ and chafe, and toss in the
spray.&rsquo;&nbsp; That long-becalmed trawler to seaward fills,
and heels over, and begins to tug and leap impatiently at the
weight of her heavy trawl.&nbsp; Five minutes more, and the
breeze will be down upon us.&nbsp; The young men whistle openly
to woo it; the old father thinks such a superstition somewhat
beneath both his years and his religion, but cannot help pursing
up his lips into a sly &lsquo;whe-eugh&rsquo; when he has got
well forward out of sight.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>Five long minutes; there is a breath of air; a soft distant
murmur; the white horses curve their necks, and dive and vanish;
and rise again like snowy porpoises, nearer, and nearer, and
nearer.&nbsp; Father and sons are struggling with that raving,
riotous, drunken squaresail forward; while we haul away upon the
main-sheet.</p>
<p>When will it come?&nbsp; It is dying back&mdash;sliding past
us.&nbsp; &lsquo;Hope deferred maketh the heart
sick.&rsquo;&nbsp; No, louder and nearer swells &lsquo;the voice
of many waters,&rsquo; &lsquo;the countless laugh of
ocean,&rsquo; like the mirth of ten thousand girls, before us,
behind us, round us; and the oily swell darkens into crisp
velvet-green, till the air strikes us, and heels us over; and
leaping, plunging, thrashing our bows into the seas, we spring
away close-hauled upon the ever-freshening breeze, while Claude
is holding on by ropes and bulwarks, and some, whose sea-legs
have not yet forgot their craft, are swinging like a pendulum as
they pace the deck, enjoying, as the Norse vikings would have
called it, &lsquo;the gallop of the flying sea-horse, and the
shiver of her tawny wings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Exquisite motion! more maddening than the smooth floating
stride of the race-horse, or the crash of the thorn-hedges before
the stalwart hunter, or the swaying of the fir-boughs in the
gale, when we used to climb as schoolboys after the lofty
hawk&rsquo;s nest; but not so maddening as the new motion of our
age&mdash;the rush of the express-train, when the live iron pants
and leaps and roars through the long chalk cutting; and white
mounds gleam cold a moment against the sky and vanish; and rocks,
and grass, and bushes, fleet by in dim blended lines; and the
long hedges revolve like the spokes of a gigantic wheel; and far
below, meadows, and streams, and homesteads, with all their lazy
old-world life, open for an instant, and then flee away; while
awe-struck, silent, choked with the mingled sense of pride and
helplessness, we are swept on by that great pulse of
England&rsquo;s life-blood, rushing down her iron veins; and
dimly out of the future looms the fulfilment of our
prim&aelig;val mission, to conquer and subdue the earth, and
space too, and time, and all things,&mdash;even, hardest of all
tasks, yourselves, my cunning brothers ever learning some fresh
lesson, except that hardest one of all, that it is the Spirit of
God which giveth you understanding.</p>
<p>Yes, great railroads, and great railroad age, who would
exchange you, with all your sins, for any other time?&nbsp; For
swiftly as rushes matter, more swiftly rushes mind; more swiftly
still rushes the heavenly dawn up the eastern sky.&nbsp;
&lsquo;The night is far spent, the day is at hand.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;Blessed is that servant whom his Lord, when He cometh,
shall find watching!&rsquo;</p>
<p>But come, my poor Claude, I see you are too sick for such deep
subjects; so let us while away the time by picking the brains of
this tall handsome boy at the helm, who is humming a love-song to
himself sotto voce, lest it should be overheard by the
grey-headed father, who is forward, poring over his Wesleyan
hymn-book.&nbsp; He will have something to tell you; he has a
soul in him looking out of those wild dark eyes, and delicate
aquiline features of his.&nbsp; He is no spade-drudge or
bullet-headed Saxon clod: he has in his veins the blood of Danish
rovers and passionate southern Milesians, who came hither from
Teffrobani, the Isle of Summer, as the old Fenic myths inform
us.&nbsp; Come and chat with him.&nbsp; You dare not stir?&nbsp;
Perhaps you are in the right.&nbsp; I shall go and fraternize,
and bring you reports.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * *</p>
<p>He has been, at all events, &lsquo;up the Straits&rsquo; as
the Mediterranean voyage is called here, and seen
&lsquo;Palermy&rsquo; and the Sicilians.&nbsp; But, for his
imagination, what seems to have struck it most was that it was a
&lsquo;fine place for Jack, for a man could get mools there for a
matter of three-halfpence a-day.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And was that all you got out of him?&rsquo; asked
Claude, sickly and sulkily.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, you must not forget the halo of glory and
excitement which in a sailor&rsquo;s eyes surrounds the delights
of horseback.&nbsp; But he gave me besides a long glowing account
of the catechism which they had there, three-quarters of a mile
long.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pope Pius&rsquo;s catechism, I suppose?&rsquo;</p>
<p>So thought I, at first; but it appeared that all the dead of
the city were arranged therein, dried and dressed out in their
finest clothes, &lsquo;every sect and age,&rsquo; as Tom said,
&lsquo;by itself; as natural as life!&rsquo;&nbsp; We may hence
opine that he means some catacombs or other.</p>
<p>Poor Claude could not even get up a smile: but his sorrows
were coming swiftly to an end.&nbsp; The rock clefts grew sharper
and sharper before us.&nbsp; The soft masses of the lofty bank of
wooded cliff rose higher and higher.&nbsp; The white houses of
Clovelly, piled stair above stair up the rocks, gleamed more and
more brightly out of the green round bosoms of the forest.&nbsp;
As we shut in headland after headland, one tall conical rock
after another darkened with its black pyramid the bright orb of
the setting sun.&nbsp; Soon we began to hear the soft murmur of
the snowy surf line; then the merry voices of the children along
the shore; and running straight for the cliff-foot, we shipped
into the little pier, from whence the red-sailed herring-boats
were swarming forth like bees out of a hive, full of gay handsome
faces, and all the busy blue-jacketed life of seaport towns, to
their night&rsquo;s fishing in the bay.</p>
<h3>IV.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Clovelly</span>.</h3>
<p>A couple of days had passed, and I was crawling up the paved
stairs inaccessible to cart or carriage, which are flatteringly
denominated &lsquo;Clovelly-street,&rsquo; a landing-net full of
shells in one hand, and a couple of mackerel lines in the other;
behind me a sheer descent, roof below roof; at an angle of
45&deg;, to the pier and bay, 200 feet below, and in front,
another hundred feet above, a green amphitheatre of oak, and ash,
and larch, shutting out all but a narrow slip of sky, across
which the low, soft, formless mist was crawling, opening every
instant to show some gap of intense dark rainy blue, and send
down a hot vaporous gleam of sunshine upon the white cottages,
with their grey steaming roofs, and bright green railings, packed
one above another upon the ledges of the cliff; and on the tall
tree-fuchsias and gaudy dahlias in the little scraps of
court-yard, calling the rich faint odour out of the verbenas and
jessamines, and, alas! out of the herring-heads and tails also,
as they lay in the rivulet; and lighting up the wings of the
gorgeous butterflies, almost unknown in our colder eastern
climate, which fluttered from woodland down to garden, and from
garden up to woodland, and seemed to form the connecting link
between that swarming hive of human industry and the deep wild
woods in which it was embosomed.&nbsp; So up I was crawling, to
dine off gurnards of my own catching,&mdash;excellent fish,
despised by deluded Cockneys, who fancy that because its head is
large and prickly, therefore its flesh is not as firm, and sweet,
and white, as that of any cod who ever gobbled
shell-fish,&mdash;when down the stair front of me, greasy as ice
from the daily shower, came slipping and staggering, my friend
Claude, armed with camp-stool and portfolio.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Where have you been wandering to-day?&rsquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &lsquo;Have you yet been as far as the park, which,
as I told you, would supply such endless subjects for your
pencil?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not I.&nbsp; I have been roaming up and down this same
&ldquo;New Road&rdquo; above us; and find there materials for a
good week&rsquo;s more work, if I could afford it.&nbsp; Indeed,
it was only to-day, for the first time, that I got as far as the
lodge at the end of it, and then was glad enough to turn back
shuddering at the first glimpse of the flat, dreary moorland
beyond,&mdash;as Adam may have turned back into Eden after a peep
out of the gates of Paradise.&rsquo;</p>
<p>He should have taken courage and gone a half-mile
further,&mdash;to the furze-grown ruins of a great Roman camp,
which gives its name to the place,
&lsquo;Clovelly,&rsquo;&mdash;Vallum Clausum, or Vallis Clausa,
as antiquarians derive it; perhaps, &lsquo;the hidden
camp,&rsquo; or glen,&mdash;perhaps something else.&nbsp; Who
cares?&nbsp; The old Romans were there, at least 10,000 strong:
and some sentimental tribune or other of them had taste enough to
perch his summer-house out on a conical point of the Hartland
Cliffs, now tumbling into the sea, tesselated pavement, baths and
all.&nbsp; And strange work, no doubt, went on in that lonely
nook, looking out over the Atlantic swell,&mdash;nights and days
fit for Petronius&rsquo;s own pen, among a seraglio of dark
Celtic beauties.&nbsp; Perhaps it could not be otherwise.&nbsp;
An ugly state of things&mdash;as heathen conquests always must
have been; yet even in it there was a use and meaning.&nbsp; But
they are past like a dream, those 10,000 stalwart men, who looked
far and wide over the Damnonian moors from a station which would
be, even in these days, a first-rate military position.&nbsp;
Gone, too, are the old Saxon Franklins who succeeded.&nbsp; Old
Wrengils, or some such name, whoever he was, at last found some
one&rsquo;s bill too hard for his brain-pan; and there he lies on
the hill above, in his &lsquo;barrow&rsquo; of Wrinklebury.&nbsp;
And gone, too, the gay Norman squire, who, as tradition says,
kept his fair lady in the old watch-tower, on the highest point
of the White Cliff&mdash;&lsquo;Gallantry Bower,&rsquo; as they
call it to this day&mdash;now a mere ring of turf-covered stones,
and a few low stunted oaks, shorn by the Atlantic blasts into the
shape of two huge cannon, which form a favourite landmark for the
fisherman of the bay.&nbsp; Gone they all are, Cymry and Roman,
Saxon and Norman; and upon the ruins of their accumulated labour
we stand here.&nbsp; Each of them had his use,&mdash;planted a
few more trees or cleared a few more, tilled a fresh scrap of
down, organized a scrap more of chaos.&nbsp; Who dare wish the
tide of improvement, which has been flowing for nineteen
centuries, swifter and swifter still as it goes on, to stop, just
because it is not convenient to us just now to move on?&nbsp; It
will not take another nineteen hundred years, be sure, to make
even this lovely nook as superior to what it is now as it is now
to the little knot of fishing huts where naked Britons peeped
out, trembling at the iron tramp of each insolent legionary from
the camp above.&nbsp; It will not take another nineteen hundred
years to develope the capabilities of this place,&mdash;to make
it the finest fishery in England, next to Torbay,&mdash;the only
safe harbour of refuge for West Indiamen, along sixty miles of
ruthless coast,&mdash;and a commercial centre for a vast tract of
half-tilled land within, which only requires means of conveyance
to be as fertile and valuable as nine-tenths of England.&nbsp;
Meanwhile Claude ought to have seen the deer-park.&nbsp; The
panorama from that old ruined &lsquo;bower&rsquo; of cliff and
woodland, down and sea, is really unique in its way.</p>
<p>&lsquo;So is the whole place, in my eyes,&rsquo; said
Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have seen nothing in England to be
compared to this little strip of paradise between two great waste
worlds of sea and moor.&nbsp; Lynmouth might be matched among the
mountains of Wales and Ireland.&nbsp; The first three miles of
the Rheidol, from the Devil&rsquo;s Bridge towards Aberystwith,
or the gorge of the Wye, down the opposite watershed of the same
mountains, from Castle Dufferin down to Rhaiadyr, are equal to it
in magnificence of form and colour, and superior in size.&nbsp;
But I question whether anything ever charmed me more than did the
return to the sounds of nature which greeted me to-day, as I
turned back from the dreary, silent moorland turnpike into this
new road, terraced along the cliffs and woods&mdash;those who
first thought of cutting it must have had souls in them above the
herd&mdash;and listened to a glorious concert in four parts,
blending and supporting each other in exquisite harmony, from the
shrill treble of a thousand birds, and the soft melancholy alto
of the moaning woods, downward through the rich tenor hum of
innumerable insects, who hung like sparks of fire beneath the
glades of oak, to the bass of the unseen surge below,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Whose deep and
dreadful organ-pipe,&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>far below me, contrasted strangely with the rich soft inland
character of the deep woods, luxuriant ferns, and gaudy
flowers.&nbsp; It is that very contrast which makes the place so
unique.&nbsp; One is accustomed to connect with the notion of the
sea bare cliffs, breezy downs, stunted shrubs struggling for
existence: and instead of them behold a forest wall, 500 feet
high, of almost semi-tropic luxuriance.&nbsp; At one turn, a deep
glen, with its sea of green woods, filled up at the mouth with
the bright azure sheet of ocean.&mdash;Then some long stretch of
the road would be banked on one side with crumbling rocks,
festooned with heath, and golden hawkweed, and London pride, like
velvet cushions covered with pink lace, and beds of white bramble
blossom alive with butterflies; while above my head, and on my
right, the cool canopy of oak and birch leaves shrouded me so
close, that I could have fancied myself miles inland, buried in
some glen unknown to any wind of heaven, but that everywhere
between green sprays and grey stems, gleamed that same boundless
ocean blue, seeming, from the height at which I was, to mount
into the very sky.&nbsp; It looked but a step out of the leafy
covert into blank infinity.&nbsp; And then, as the road wound
round some point, one&rsquo;s eye could fall down, down, through
the abyss of perpendicular wood, tree below tree clinging to and
clothing the cliff, or rather no cliff; but perpendicular sheet
of deep wood sedge, and broad crown ferns, spreading their
circular fans.&mdash;But there is no describing them, or painting
them either.&mdash;And then to see how the midday sunbeams leapt
past one down the abyss, throwing out here a grey stem by one
point of burnished silver, there a hazel branch by a single leaf
of glowing golden green, shooting long bright arrows down,
through the dim, hot, hazy atmosphere of the wood, till it rested
at last upon the dappled beach of pink and grey pebbles, and the
dappled surge which wandered up and down among them, and broke up
into richer intricacy with its chequer-work of woodland shadows,
the restless net of snowy foam.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You must be fresh from reading Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s book,
Claude, to be able to give birth to such a piece of complex
magniloquence as that last period of yours.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Why, I saw all that, and ten thousand things more; and
yet do you complain of me for having tried to put one out of all
those thousand things into words?&nbsp; And what do you mean by
sneering at Mr. Ruskin?&nbsp; Are there not in his books more and
finer passages of descriptive
poetry&mdash;word-painting&mdash;call them what you will, than in
any other prose book in the English language?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Not a doubt of it, my dear Claude; but it will not do
for every one to try Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s tools.&nbsp; Neither you
nor I possess that almost Roman severity, that stern precision of
conception and expression, which enables him to revel in the most
gorgeous language, without ever letting it pall upon the
reader&rsquo;s taste by affectation or over-lusciousness.&nbsp;
His style is like the very hills along which you have been
travelling, whose woods enrich, without enervating, the grand
simplicity of their forms.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The comparison is just,&rsquo; said Claude.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Mr. Ruskin&rsquo;s style, like those very hills, and like,
too, the Norman cathedrals of which he is so fond, is rather
magnified than concealed by the innumerable multiplicity of its
ornamental chasing and colouring.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And is not that,&rsquo; I asked, &lsquo;the very
highest achievement of artistic style?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Doubtless.&nbsp; The severe and grand simplicity, of
which folks talk so much, is great indeed; but only the greatest
as long as men are still ignorant of Nature&rsquo;s art of
draping her forms with colour, chiaroscuro, ornament, not at the
expense of the original design, but in order to perfect it by
making it appeal to every faculty instead of those of form and
size alone.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Still you will allow the beauty of a bare rock, a down,
a church spire, a sheet or line of horizontal water,&mdash;their
necessity to the completion of a landscape.&nbsp; I recollect
well having the value of a stern straight line in Nature brought
home to me, when, during a long ride in the New Forest, after my
eye had become quite dulled and wearied with the monotonous
softness of rolling lawns, feathery heath, and rounded oak and
beech woods, I suddenly caught sight of the sharp peaked roof of
Rhinefield Lodge, and its row of tall stiff poplar-spires,
cutting the endless sea of curves.&nbsp; The relief to my eye was
delicious.&nbsp; I really believe it heightened the pleasure with
which I reined in my mare for a chat with old Toomer the keeper,
and the noble bloodhound who eyed me from between his
master&rsquo;s legs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I can well believe it.&nbsp; Simple lines in a
landscape are of the same value as the naked parts of a
richly-clothed figure.&nbsp; They act both as contrasts and as
indications of the original substratum of the figure; but to say
that severe simplicity is the highest ideal is mere pedantry and
Manicheism.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Oh, everything is Manicheism with you,
Claude!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And no wonder, while the world is as full of it now as
it was in the thirteenth century.&nbsp; But let that pass.&nbsp;
This craving after so-called classic art, whether it be
Manicheism or not, is certainly a fighting against God,&mdash;a
contempt of everything which He has taught us artists since the
introduction of Christianity.&nbsp; I abominate this setting up
of Sculpture above Painting, of the Greeks above the
Italians,&mdash;as if all Eastern civilization, all Christian
truth, had taught art nothing,&mdash;as if there was not more
real beauty in a French cathedral or a Venetian palazzo than in a
dozen Parthenons, and more soul in one Rafaelle, or Titian
either, than in all the Greek statues of the Tribune or
Vatican.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;You have changed your creed, I see, and, like all
converts, are somewhat fierce and fanatical.&nbsp; You used to
believe in Zeuxis and Parrhasius in old times.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yes, as long as I believed in Fuseli&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Lectures;&rdquo; but when I saw at Pompeii the ancient
paintings which still remain to us, my faith in their powers
received its first shock; and when I re-read in the Lectures of
Fuseli and his school all their extravagant praises of the Greek
painters, and separated their few facts fairly out from among the
floods of rant on which they floated, I came to the conclusion
that the ancients knew as little of colour or chiaroscuro as they
did of perspective, and as little of spiritual expression as they
did of landscape-painting.&nbsp; What do I care for the birds
pecking at Zeuxis&rsquo;s grapes, or Zeuxis himself trying to
draw back Parrhasius&rsquo;s curtain?&nbsp; Imitative art is the
lowest trickery.&nbsp; There are twenty men in England now
capable of the same sleight of hand; and yet these are recorded
as the very highest triumphs of ancient art by the only men who
have handed down to us any record of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;It may be so; or again, it may not.&nbsp; But do not
fancy, Claude, that classic sculpture has finished its work on
earth.&nbsp; You know that it has taught you what Gothic art
could never teach,&mdash;the ideal of physical health and
strength.&nbsp; Believe that it exists, and will exist, to remind
the puny town-dweller of the existence of that ideal; to say to
the artisan, every time he looks upon a statue&mdash;such God
intended you to be; such you may be; such your class will be, in
some future healthy state of civilization, when Sanitary Reform
and Social Science shall be accepted and carried out as primary
duties of a government toward the nation.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Surely, classic sculpture remains, as a witness of the
prim&aelig;val paradise; a witness that man and woman were
created at first healthy, and strong, and fair, and innocent;
just as classic literature remains for a witness that the heathen
of old were taught of God; that we have something to learn of
them, summed up in that now obsolete word
&ldquo;virtue&rdquo;&mdash;true and wholesome manhood, which we
are likely to forget, and are forgetting daily, under the
enervating shadow of popular superstitions. <a
name="citation287"></a><a href="#footnote287"
class="citation">[287]</a>&nbsp; And till we have learnt that,
may Greek books still form the basis of our liberal education,
and may Greek statues, or even English attempts to copy them,
fill public halls and private houses.&nbsp; This generation may
not understand their divine and eternal significance; but a
future generation, doubt it not, will spell it out right
well.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Claude and I went forth along the cliffs of a park, which,
though not of the largest, is certainly of the loveliest in
England,&mdash;perhaps unique, from that abrupt contact of the
richest inland scenery with the open sea, which is its
distinctive feature.&nbsp; As we wandered along the edge of the
cliff, beneath us on our left lay wooded valleys, lawns spotted
with deer, stately timber trees, oak and beech, birch and alder,
growing as full and round-headed as if they had been buried in
some Shropshire valley fifty miles inland, instead of having the
Atlantic breezes all the winter long sweeping past a few hundred
feet above their still seclusion.&nbsp; Glens of forest wound
away into the high inner land, with silver burns sparkling here
and there under their deep shadows; while from the lawns beneath,
the ground sloped rapidly upwards towards us, to stop short in a
sheer wall of cliff, over which the deer were leaning to crop the
shoots of ivy, where the slipping of a stone would have sent them
400 feet perpendicular into the sea.&nbsp; On our right, from our
very feet, the sea spread out to the horizon; a single falcon was
wheeling about the ledges below; a single cormorant was fishing
in the breakers, diving and rising again like some tiny
water-beetle;</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lsquo;The murmuring surge<br />
That on the unnumbered pebbles idly chafed<br />
Could not be heard so high.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The only sound beside the rustle of the fern before the
startled deer was the soft mysterious treble of the wind as it
swept over the face of the cliff beneath us; but the cool air was
confined to the hill-tops round beneath, from within a short
distance of the shore, the sea was shrouded in soft summer
haze.&nbsp; The far Atlantic lay like an ocean of white wool, out
of which the Hartland Cliffs and the highest point of Lundy just
showed their black peaks.&nbsp; Here and there the western sun
caught one white bank of mist after another, and tinged them with
glowing gold; while nearer us long silvery zigzag tide-lines,
which we could have fancied the tracks of water-fairies, wandered
away under the smoky grey-brown shadows of the fog, and seemed to
vanish hundreds of miles off into the void of space, so
completely was all notion of size or distance destroyed by the
soft gradations of the mist.&nbsp; Suddenly, as we stood
watching, a breeze from the eastward dived into the basin of the
bay, swept the clouds out, packed them together, rolled them over
each other, and hurled them into the air miles high in one
Cordillera of snowy mountains, sailing slowly out into the
Atlantic; and behold, instead of the chaos of mist, the whole
amphitheatre of cliffs, with their gay green woods and spots of
bright red marl and cold black ironstone, and the gleaming white
sands of Braunton, and the hills of Exmoor bathed in sunshine, so
near and clear we almost fancied we could see the pink
heather-hue upon them; and the bay one vast rainbow, ten miles of
flame-colour and purple, emerald and ultramarine, flecked with a
thousand spots of flying snow.&nbsp; No one knows what gigantic
effects of colour even our temperate zone can show, till they
have been in Devonshire and Cornwall; and last, but not least, in
Ireland&mdash;the Emerald Isle, in truth.&nbsp; No stay-at-home
knows the colour of the sea till he has seen the West of England;
and no one, either stay-at-home or traveller, I suspect, knows
what the colour of a green field can be till he has seen it among
the magic smiles and tears of an Irish summer shower in county
Down.</p>
<p>Down we wandered from our height through &lsquo;trim walks and
alleys green,&rsquo; where the arbutus and gumcistus fringed the
cliffs, and through the deep glades of the park, towards the
delicious little cove which bounds it.&mdash;A deep crack in the
wooded hills, an old mill half buried in rocks and flowers, a
stream tinkling on from one rock-basin to another towards the
beach, a sandy lawn gay with sea-side flowers over which wild
boys and bare-footed girls were driving their ponies with
panniers full of sand, and as they rattled back to the beach for
a fresh load, standing upright on the backs of their steeds, with
one foot in each pannier, at full trot over rocks and stones
where a landsman would find it difficult to walk on his own
legs.</p>
<p>Enraptured with the place and people, Claude pulled out his
sketch-book and sat down.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What extraordinary rocks!&rsquo; said he, at
length.&nbsp; &lsquo;How different from those Cyclopean blocks
and walls along the Exmoor cliffs are these rich purple and olive
ironstone layers, with their sharp serrated lines and polished
slabs, set up on edge, snapped, bent double, twisted into
serpentine curves, every sheet of cliff scored with sharp
parallel lines at some fresh fantastic angle!&rsquo;</p>
<p>Yes; there must have been strange work here when all these
strata were being pressed and squeezed together like a ream of
wet paper between the rival granite pincers of Dartmoor and
Lundy.&nbsp; They must have suffered enough then in a few years
to give them a fair right to lie quiet till Doomsday, as they
seem likely to do.&nbsp; But it is only old Mother Earth who has
fallen asleep hereabouts.&nbsp; Air and sea are just as live as
ever.&nbsp; Ay, lovely and calm enough spread beneath us there
the broad semicircle of the bay; but to know what it can be, it
should be seen as I have seen it, when, in the roaring December
morning, we have been galloping along the cliffs,
wreck-hunting.&mdash;One morning I can remember well, how we
watched from the Hartland Cliffs a great barque, which came
drifting and rolling in before the western gale, while we
followed her up the coast, parsons and sportsmen, farmers and
Preventive men, with the Manby&rsquo;s mortar lumbering behind us
in a cart, through stone gaps and track-ways, from headland to
headland.&mdash;The maddening excitement of expectation as she
ran wildly towards the cliffs at our feet, and then sheered off
again inexplicably;&mdash;her foremast and bowsprit, I recollect,
were gone short off by the deck; a few rags of sail fluttered
from her main and mizen.&nbsp; But with all straining of eyes and
glasses, we could discern no sign of man on board.&nbsp; Well I
recollect the mingled disappointment and admiration of the
Preventive men, as a fresh set of salvors appeared in view, in
the form of a boat&rsquo;s crew of Clovelly fishermen; how we
watched breathlessly the little black speck crawling and
struggling up in the teeth of the gale, under the shelter of the
land, till, when the ship had rounded a point into smoother
water, she seized on her like some tiny spider on a huge unwieldy
fly; and then how one still smaller black speck showed aloft on
the main-yard, and another&mdash;and then the desperate efforts
to get the topsail set&mdash;and how we saw it tear out of their
hands again, and again, and again, and almost fancied we could
hear the thunder of its flappings above the roar of the gale, and
the mountains of surf which made the rocks ring beneath our
feet;&mdash;and how we stood silent, shuddering, expecting every
moment to see whirled into the sea from the plunging yards one of
those same tiny black specks, in each one of which was a living
human soul, with sad women praying for him at home!&nbsp; And
then how they tried to get her head round to the wind, and
disappeared instantly in a cloud of white spray&mdash;and let her
head fall back again&mdash;and jammed it round again, and
disappeared again&mdash;and at last let her drive helplessly up
the bay, while we kept pace with her along the cliffs; and how at
last, when she had been mastered and fairly taken in tow, and was
within two miles of the pier, and all hearts were merry with the
hopes of a prize which would make them rich, perhaps, for years
to come&mdash;one-third, I suppose, of the whole value of her
cargo&mdash;how she broke loose from them at the last moment, and
rushed frantically in upon those huge rocks below us, leaping
great banks of slate at the blow of each breaker, tearing off
masses of ironstone which lie there to this day to tell the tale,
till she drove up high and dry against the cliff, and lay, like
an enormous stranded whale, grinding and crashing herself to
pieces against the walls of her adamantine cage.&nbsp; And well I
recollect the sad records of the log-book which was left on board
the deserted ship; how she had been waterlogged for weeks and
weeks, buoyed up by her timber cargo, the crew clinging in the
tops, and crawling down, when they dared, for putrid biscuit-dust
and drops of water, till the water was washed overboard and gone;
and then notice after notice, &lsquo;On this day such an one
died,&rsquo; &lsquo;On this day such an one was washed
away&rsquo;&mdash;the log kept up to the last, even when there
was only that to tell, by the stern business-like merchant
skipper, whoever he was; and how at last, when there was neither
food nor water, the strong man&rsquo;s heart seemed to have
quailed, or perhaps risen, into a prayer, jotted down in the
log&mdash;&lsquo;The Lord have mercy on us!&rsquo;&mdash;and then
a blank of several pages, and, scribbled with a famine-shaken
hand, &lsquo;Remember thy Creator in the days of thy
youth;&rsquo;&mdash;and so the log and the ship were left to the
rats, which covered the deck when our men boarded her.&nbsp; And
well I remember the last act of that tragedy; for a ship has
really, as sailors feel, a personality, almost a life and soul of
her own; and as long as her timbers hold together, all is not
over.&nbsp; You can hardly call her a corpse, though the human
beings who inhabited her, and were her soul, may have fled into
the far eternities; and so we felt that night, as we came down
along the woodland road, with the north-west wind hurling dead
branches and showers of crisp oak-leaves about our heads; till
suddenly, as we staggered out of the wood, we came upon such a
piece of chiaroscuro as would have baffled Correggio, or
Rembrandt, himself.&nbsp; Under a wall was a long tent of sails
and spars, filled with Preventive men, fishermen, Lloyd&rsquo;s
underwriters, lying about in every variety of strange attitude
and costume; while candles, stuck in bayonet-handles in the wall,
poured out a wild glare over shaggy faces and glittering weapons,
and piles of timber, and rusty iron cable, that glowed red-hot in
the light, and then streamed up the glen towards us through the
salt misty air in long fans of light, sending fiery bars over the
brown transparent oak foliage and the sad beds of withered autumn
flowers, and glorifying the wild flakes of foam, as they rushed
across the light-stream, into troops of tiny silver angels, that
vanished into the night and hid themselves among the woods from
the fierce spirit of the storm.&nbsp; And then, just where the
glare of the lights and watch-fires was most brilliant, there too
the black shadows of the cliff had placed the point of intensest
darkness, lightening gradually upwards right and left, between
the two great jaws of the glen, into a chaos of grey mist, where
the eye could discern no form of sea or cloud, but a perpetual
shifting and quivering as if the whole atmosphere was writhing
with agony in the clutches of the wind.</p>
<p>The ship was breaking up; and we sat by her like hopeless
physicians by a deathbed-side, to watch the last
struggle,&mdash;and &lsquo;the effects of the
deceased.&rsquo;&nbsp; I recollect our literally warping
ourselves down to the beach, holding on by rocks and posts.&nbsp;
There was a saddened awe-struck silence, even upon the gentleman
from Lloyd&rsquo;s with the pen behind his ear.&nbsp; A sudden
turn of the clouds let in a wild gleam of moonshine upon the
white leaping heads of the breakers, and on the pyramid of the
Black-church Rock, which stands in summer in such calm grandeur
gazing down on the smiling bay, with the white sand of Braunton
and the red cliffs of Portledge shining through its two vast
arches; and against a slab of rock on the right, for years
afterwards discoloured with her paint, lay the ship, rising
slowly on every surge, to drop again with a piteous crash as the
wave fell back from the cliff, and dragged the roaring pebbles
back with it under the coming wall of foam.&nbsp; You have heard
of ships at the last moment crying aloud like living things in
agony?&nbsp; I heard it then, as the stumps of her masts rocked
and reeled in her, and every plank and joint strained and
screamed with the dreadful tension.</p>
<p>A horrible image&mdash;a human being shrieking on the rack,
rose up before me at those strange semi-human cries, and would
not be put away&mdash;and I tried to turn, and yet my eyes were
riveted on the black mass, which seemed vainly to implore the
help of man against the stern ministers of the Omnipotent.</p>
<p>Still she seemed to linger in the death-struggle, and we
turned at last away; when, lo! a wave, huger than all before it,
rushed up the boulders towards us.&mdash;We had just time to save
ourselves.&mdash;A dull, thunderous groan, as if a mountain had
collapsed, rose above the roar of the tempest; and we all turned
with an instinctive knowledge of what had happened, just in time
to see the huge mass melt away into the boiling white, and vanish
for evermore.&nbsp; And then the very raving of the wind seemed
hushed with awe; the very breakers plunged more silently towards
the shore, with something of a sullen compunction; and as we
stood and strained our eyes into the gloom, one black plank after
another crawled up out of the darkness upon the head of the
coming surge, and threw itself at our feet like the corpse of a
drowning man, too spent to struggle more.</p>
<p>There is another subject for a picture for you, my friend
Claude: but your gayer fancy will prefer the scene just as you
are sketching it now, as still and bright as if this coast had
never seen the bay darkened with the grey columns of the
waterspouts, stalking across the waves before the northern gale;
and the tiny herring-boats fleeing from their nets right for the
breakers, hoping more mercy even from those iron walls of rock
than from the pitiless howling waste of spray behind them; and
that merry beach beside the town covered with shrieking women and
old men casting themselves on the pebbles in fruitless agonies of
prayer, as corpse after corpse swept up at the feet of wife and
child, till in one case alone a single dawn saw upwards of sixty
widows and orphans weeping over those who had gone out the night
before in the fulness of strength and courage.&nbsp; Hardly an
old playmate of mine, but is drowned and gone:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;Their graves are scattered far and wide<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; By mount, by stream, and sea.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One poor little fellow&rsquo;s face starts out of the depths
of memory as fresh as ever, my especial pet and bird-nesting
companion as a boy&mdash;a little delicate, precocious,
large-brained child, who might have written books some day, if he
had been a gentleman&rsquo;s son: but when his father&rsquo;s
ship was wrecked, they found him, left alone of all the crew,
just as he had been lashed into the rigging by loving and dying
hands, but cold and stiff, the little soul beaten out of him by
the cruel waves before it had time to show what growth there
might have been in it.&nbsp; We will talk no more of such
things.&nbsp; It is thankless to be sad when all heaven and earth
are keeping holiday under the smile of God.</p>
<p>&lsquo;And now let us return.&nbsp; At four o&rsquo;clock
to-morrow morning, you know, we are to start for
Lundy.&rsquo;</p>
<h3>V.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Lundy</span>.</h3>
<p>It was four o&rsquo;clock on an August morning.&nbsp; Our
little party had made the sleeping streets ring with jests and
greetings, as it collected on the pier.&nbsp; Some dozen young
men and women, sons and daughters of the wealthier coasting
captains and owners of fishing-smacks, chaperoned by our old
landlord, whose delicate and gentlemanlike features and figure
were strangely at variance with the history of his
life,&mdash;daring smuggler, daring man-of-war sailor, and then
most daring and successful of coastguard-men.&nbsp; After years
of fighting and shipwreck and creeping for kegs of brandy; after
having seen, too&mdash;sight not to be forgotten&mdash;the
Walcheren dykes and the Walcheren fever, through weary months of
pestilence, he had come back with a little fortune of prize-money
to be a village oracle, loving and beloved, as gentle and
courteous as if he had never &lsquo;stato al inferno,&rsquo; and
looked Death in the face.&nbsp; Heaven bless thee, shrewd loyal
heart, a gentleman of God&rsquo;s making, not unrecognized either
by many of men&rsquo;s making.</p>
<p>The other chaperone was a lady of God&rsquo;s making, too; one
who might have been a St. Theresa, had she been born there and
then; but as it was, had been fated to become only the Wesleyan
abbess of the town, and, like Deborah, &lsquo;a mother in
Israel.&rsquo;&nbsp; With her tall, slim, queenly figure, massive
forehead, glittering eyes, features beaming with tenderness and
enthusiasm, and yet overcast with a peculiar expression of
self-consciousness and restraint, well known to those who have
studied the physiognomies of &lsquo;saints,&rsquo; she seemed to
want only the dress of some monastic order to make her the ideal
of a medi&aelig;val abbess, watching with a half-pitying,
half-complacent smile, the gambols of a group of innocent young
worldlings.&nbsp; I saw Claude gazing at her full of admiration
and surprise, which latter was certainly not decreased when, as
soon as all had settled themselves comfortably on board, and the
cutter was slipping quietly away under the magnificent deer-park
cliffs, the Lady Abbess, pulling out her Wesleyan hymn-book, gave
out the Morning Hymn, apparently as a matter of course.</p>
<p>With hardly a demur one sweet voice after another arose; then
a man gained courage, and chimed in with a full harmonious bass;
then a rich sad alto made itself heard, as it wandered in and out
between the voices of the men and women; and at last a wild
mellow tenor, which we discovered after much searching to proceed
from the most unlikely-looking lips of an old dry,
weather-bleared, mummified chrysalis of a man, who stood aft,
steering with his legs, and showing no sign of life except when
he slowly and solemnly filled his nose with snuff.</p>
<p>&lsquo;What strange people have you brought me among?&rsquo;
asked Claude.&nbsp; &lsquo;I have been wondering ever since I
came here at the splendid faces and figures of men, women, and
children, which popped out upon me from every door in that human
rabbit-burrow above.&nbsp; I have been in raptures at the
gracefulness, the courtesy, the intelligence of almost everyone I
meet; and now, to crown all, everyone among them seems to be a
musician.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Really you are not far wrong, and you will find them as
remarkable morally as they are physically and
intellectually.&nbsp; The simplicity and purity of the women here
put one more in mind of the valleys of the Tyrol than of an
English village.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;And in proportion to their purity, I suppose,&rsquo;
said Claude, &lsquo;is their freedom and
affectionateness?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Exactly.&nbsp; It would do your
&ldquo;naturalist&rdquo; heart good, Claude, to see a young
fellow just lauded from a foreign voyage rolling up the street
which we have just descended, and availing himself of the
immemorial right belonging to such cases of kissing and being
kissed by every woman whom he meets, young and old.&nbsp; You
will find yourself here among those who are too simple-minded,
and too full of self-respect, to be either servile or
uncourteous.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I have found out already that Liberty, Fraternity, and
Equality, in such company as this, are infinitely pleasanter, as
well as cheaper, than the aristocratic seclusion of a cutter
hired for our own behoof.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;True; and now you will not go home and, as most
tourists do, say that you know a place, without knowing the
people who live in it&mdash;as if the human inhabitants of a
range of scenery were not among its integral and most important
parts&mdash;&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What! are Copley Fielding&rsquo;s South Down landscapes
incomplete without a half-starved seven shillings a-week labourer
in the foreground?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Honestly, are they not a text without a sermon? a
premise without a conclusion?&nbsp; Is it not partly because the
land is down, and not well-tilled arable, that the labourer is
what he is?&nbsp; And yet, perhaps, the very absence of human
beings in his vast sheets of landscape, when one considers that
they are scraps of great, overcrowded, scientific England in the
nineteenth century, is in itself the bitterest of satires.&nbsp;
But, hush! there is another hymn commencing&mdash;not to be the
last by many.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>We had landed, and laughed, and scrambled, eaten and drunk,
seen all the sights of Lundy, and heard all the traditions.&nbsp;
Are they not written in Mr. Bamfield&rsquo;s Ilfracombe
Guide?&nbsp; Why has not some one already written a
fire-and-brimstone romance about them?&nbsp; &lsquo;Moresco
Castle; or, the Pirate Knight of the Atlantic Wave.&rsquo;&nbsp;
What a title!&nbsp; Or again&mdash;&lsquo;The Seal Fiend; or, the
Nemesis of the Scuttled West Indiaman.&rsquo;&mdash;If I had
paper and lubricit&eacute; enough, and that delightful
carelessness of any moral or purpose, except that of fine writing
and money-making, which possesses some modern scribblers&mdash;I
could tales unfold&mdash;But neither pirate legends, nor tales of
cheated insurance offices, nor wrecks and murders, will make us
understand Lundy&mdash;what it is &lsquo;considered in its
idea,&rsquo; as the new argot is.&nbsp; It may be defined as a
lighthouse-bearing island.&nbsp; The whole three miles of granite
table-land, seals, sea-birds, and human beings, are mere
accidents and appendages&mdash;the pedestal and the ornaments of
that great white tower in the centre, whose sleepless fiery eye
blinks all night long over the night-mists of the Atlantic.&nbsp;
If, as a wise man has said, the days will come when our
degenerate posterity will fall down and worship rusty locomotives
and fossil electric-telegraphs, the relics of their
ancestors&rsquo; science, grown to them mythic and impossible, as
the Easter-islanders bow before the colossal statues left by a
nobler and extinct race, then surely there will be pilgrimages to
Lundy, and prayers to that white granite tower, with its unglazed
lantern and rusting machinery, to light itself up again, and help
poor human beings!&nbsp; Really, my dear brothers, I am not in
jest: you seem but too likely now-a-days to arrive at some such
catastrophe&mdash;sentimental philosophy for the
&lsquo;enlightened&rsquo; few, and fetish-worship (of which
nominally Christian forms are as possible as heathen ones) for
the masses.&mdash;At that you may only too probably
arrive&mdash;unless you repent, and &lsquo;get back your
souls.&rsquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">* * * * *</p>
<p>We had shot along the cliffs a red-legged chough or two, and
one of the real black English rat, exterminated on the mainland
by the grey Hanoverian newcomer; and weary with sight-seeing and
scrambling, we sat down to meditate on a slab of granite, which
hung three hundred feet in air above the western main.</p>
<p>&lsquo;This is even more strange and new to me,&rsquo; said
Claude, at length, &lsquo;than anything I have yet seen in this
lovely West.&nbsp; I now appreciate Ruskin&rsquo;s advice to
oil-painters to go and study the coasts of Devon and Cornwall,
instead of lingering about the muddy seas and tame cliffs of the
Channel and the German Ocean.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;How clear and brilliant,&rsquo; said I,
&lsquo;everything shows through this Atlantic atmosphere.&nbsp;
The intensity of colouring may vie with that of the shores of the
Mediterranean.&nbsp; The very raininess of the climate, by
condensing the moisture into an ever-changing phantasmagoria of
clouds, leaves the clear air and sunshine, when we do get a
glimpse of them, all the more pure and transparent.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The distinctive feature of the scene is, in my eyes,
the daring juxtaposition of large simple masses of positive
colour.&nbsp; There are none of the misty enamelled tones of
Lynmouth, or the luscious richness of Clovelly.&nbsp; The forms
are so simple and severe, that they would be absolutely meagre,
were it not for the rich colouring with which Nature has so
lovingly made up for the absence of all softness, all picturesque
outline.&nbsp; One does not regret or even feel the want of trees
here, while the eye ranges down from that dappled cloud-world
above, over that sheet of purple heather, those dells bedded with
dark green fern, of a depth and richness of hue which I never saw
before&mdash;over those bright grey granite rocks, spangled with
black glittering mica and golden lichens, to rest at last on that
sea below, which streams past the island in a swift roaring
torrent of tide.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Sea, Claude? say, ocean.&nbsp; This is real Atlantic
blue here beneath us.&nbsp; No more Severn mud, no more
grass-green bay-water, but real ocean sapphire&mdash;dark, deep,
intense, Homeric purple, it spreads away, away, there before us,
without a break or islet, to the shores of America.&nbsp; You are
sitting on one of the last points of Europe; and therefore all
things round you are stern and strange with a barbaric pomp, such
as befits the boundary of a world.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Ay, the very form of the cliffs shows them to be the
breakwaters of a continent.&nbsp; No more fantastic curves and
bands of slate, such as harmonize so well with the fairyland
which we left this morning; the cliffs, with their horizontal
rows of cubical blocks, seem built up by Cyclopean
hands.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Yet how symbolic is the difference between them and
that equally Cyclopic masonry of the Exmoor coast.&nbsp; There
every fracture is fresh, sharp-edged, crystalline; the worn-out
useless hills are dropping to pieces with their own weight.&nbsp;
Here each cube is delicately rounded off at the edges, every
crack worn out into a sinuous furrow, like the scars of an
everlasting warfare with the winds and waves.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Does it not raise strange longings in you,&rsquo; said
Claude, &lsquo;to gaze out yonder over the infinite calm, and
then to remember that beyond it lies America!&mdash;the new
world; the future world; the great Titan-baby, who will be
teeming with new Athens and Londons, with new Bacons and
Shakspeares, Newtons and Goethes, when this old worn-out island
will be&mdash;what?&nbsp; Oh! when I look out here, like a bird
from its cage, a captive from his dungeon, and remember what lies
behind me, to what I must return to-morrow&mdash;the over-peopled
Babylon of misery and misrule, puffery and covetousness&mdash;and
there before me great countries untilled, uncivilized,
unchristianized, crying aloud for man to come and be man indeed,
and replenish the earth and subdue it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh that I had
wings as a dove, then would I flee away and be at
rest!&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, lead me away; my body is growing as
dizzy as my mind.&nbsp; I feel coming over me that horrible
longing of which I have heard, to leap out into empty
space.&nbsp; How the blank air whispers, &ldquo;Be
free!&rdquo;&nbsp; How the broad sea smiles, and calls, with its
ten thousand waves, &ldquo;Be free!&rdquo;&mdash;As I live, if
you do not take me away I shall throw myself over the
cliff.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I did take him away, for I knew the sensation and its danger
well.&nbsp; It has nothing to do with physical giddiness.&nbsp;
Those who are cliff-bred, and who never were giddy for an instant
in their lives, have often felt themselves impelled to leap from
masts, and tree-tops, and cliffs; and nothing but the most
violent effort of will could break the fascination.&nbsp; I
cannot but think, by the bye, that many a puzzling suicide might
be traced to this same emotion acting on a weak and morbid
brain.</p>
<p>We returned to the little landing cove.&nbsp; The red-sailed
cutter lay sleeping below us&mdash;&lsquo;floating double, ship
and shadow.&rsquo;&nbsp; Shoals of innumerable mackerel broke up,
making acres of water foam and sparkle round their silvery sides,
with a soft roar (call it &lsquo;a bull&rsquo; if you like, it is
the only expression for that mysterious sound), while among them
the black head of a huge seal was slowly and silently appearing
and vanishing, as he got his dinner, in a quiet business-like
way, among the unhappy wanderers.</p>
<p>We put off in the boat, and just halfway from the cutter
Claude gave a start, and the women a scream, as the enormous
brute quietly raised his head and shoulders out of the water ten
yards off, with a fish kicking in his mouth, and the water
running off his nose, to take a deliberate stare at us, after the
fashion of seals, whose ruling passion is curiosity.&nbsp; The
sound of a musical instrument, the sight of a man
bathing&mdash;anything, in short, which their small wits cannot
explain at first sight, is enough to make them forget all their
cunning, and thrust their heads suicidally into any danger; and
even so it fared with the &lsquo;black man,&rsquo; as the girls,
in their first terror, declared him to be.&nbsp; Some
fellow&rsquo;s gun went off&mdash;of itself I should like to
believe&mdash;but the whole charge disappeared into his sleek
round visage, knocking the mackerel from between his teeth; and
he turned over, a seven-foot lump of lifeless blubber.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Wretch!&rsquo; cried Claude, as we dragged the seal
into the boat, where he lay with his head and arms hanging
helplessly over the bows, like a sea-sick alderman on board a
Margate steamer.&nbsp; &lsquo;What excuse can he give for such a
piece of wanton cruelty?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;I assure you his skin and oil are very
valuable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Pish!&mdash;Was he thinking of skin and oil when he
pulled the trigger? or merely obeying the fleshly lust of
destructiveness&mdash;the puppet of two bumps on the back of his
head?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;My dear Claude, man is the microcosm; and as the
highest animal, the ideal type of the mammalia, he, like all true
types, comprises in himself the attributes of all lower
species.&nbsp; Therefore he must have a tiger-vein in him, my
dear Claude, as well as a beaver-vein and a spider-vein; and no
more shame to him.&nbsp; You are a butterfly; that good fellow a
beast of prey; both may have their own work to do in this age
just as they had in the old ones; and if you do not like that
explanation, all I can say is, I can sympathise with you and with
him too.&nbsp; Homo sum&mdash;humani nihil a me alienum
puto.&nbsp; Trim the boat, lads, or the seal will swamp us, and,
like Samson, slay more in his death than ever he slew in his
life.&rsquo;</p>
<p>We slipped on homeward.&nbsp; The cliff-wall of Lundy stood
out blacker and blacker every moment against the gay western sky;
greens, greys, and purples, dyeing together into one deep rich
monotone, for which our narrow colour-vocabulary has no word; and
threw a long cold shadow towards us across the golden sea;
suddenly above its dark ridge a wild wreath of low rack caught
the rays of the setting sun, and flamed up like a volcano towards
the dun and purple canopy of upper clouds.&nbsp; Before us the
blue sea and the blue land-line were fading into mournful grey,
on which one huge West Indiaman blazed out, orange and scarlet,
her crowded canvas all a-flame from the truck to the
water&rsquo;s edge.&mdash;A few moments and she, too, had
vanished into the grey twilight, and a chill night-wind crisped
the sea.&nbsp; It was a relief to hear the Evening Hymn rise rich
and full from one voice, and then another and another, till the
men chimed in one by one, and the whole cutter, from stem to
stern, breathed up its melody into the silent night.</p>
<p>But the hymn soon flagged&mdash;there was more mirth on board
than could vent itself in old Charles Wesley&rsquo;s words; and
one began to hum a song tune, and then another, with a side
glance at the expression of the Lady Abbess&rsquo;s face, till at
last, when a fair wife took courage, and burst out with full pipe
into &lsquo;The sea, the sea,&rsquo; the ice was fairly broken;
and among jests and laughter one merry harmless song after
another rang out, many of them, to Claude&rsquo;s surprise,
fashionable London ones, which sounded strangely enough out there
on the wild western sea.&nbsp; At last&mdash;&lsquo;Claude,
friend,&rsquo; I whispered, &lsquo;you must sing your share
too&mdash;and mine also, for that matter.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;What shall I sing?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;Anything you will, from the sublime to the
ridiculous.&nbsp; They will understand and appreciate it as well
as yourself.&nbsp; Recollect, you are not among bullet-headed
South Saxon clods, but among wits as keen and imaginations as
rich as those of any Scotch shepherd or Manchester
operative.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And up rose his exquisite tenor.</p>
<p>This was his first song, but it was not allowed to be his
last.&nbsp; German ballads, Italian Opera airs, were all just as
warmly, and perhaps far more sincerely appreciated, as they would
have been by any London evening-party; and the singing went on,
hour after hour, as we slipped slowly on upon the tide, till it
grew late, and the sweet voices died away one by one; and then
the Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity which had reigned so
pleasantly throughout the day took a new form, as the women
huddled together to sleep in each other&rsquo;s arms; and the men
and we clustered forwards, while from every mouth fragrant
incense steamed upwards into the air.&nbsp; &lsquo;Man a cooking
animal?&rsquo; my dear Doctor Johnson&mdash;pooh! man is a
smoking animal.&nbsp; There is his ergon, his &lsquo;differential
energy,&rsquo; as the Aristotelians say&mdash;his true
distinction from the ourang-outang.&nbsp; Ponder it well.</p>
<p>The men were leaning on the trawl capstan, while our old
landlord, with half-a-dozen pipes within a foot of his face,
droned out some long sea-yarn about Ostend, and muds, and
snow-storms, and revenue-cruisers going down stern foremost, kegs
of brandy and French prisons, which I shall not repeat; for
indeed the public has been surfeited with sea-stories of late,
from many sufficiently dull ones up to the genial wisdom of
&lsquo;Peter Simple,&rsquo; and the gorgeous word-painting of
&lsquo;Tom Cringle&rsquo;s Log.&rsquo;&nbsp; And now the subject
is stale&mdash;the old war and the wonders thereof have died away
into the past, like the men who fought in it; and Trafalgar and
the Bellerophon are replaced by Manchester and &lsquo;Mary
Barton.&rsquo;&nbsp; We have solved the old sea-going problems
pretty well&mdash;thanks to wise English-hearted Captain Marryat,
now gone to his rest, just when his work was done; and we must
turn round and face a few land-going problems not quite so easy
of solution.&nbsp; So Claude and I thought, as we leant over the
sloop&rsquo;s bows, listening neither to the Ostend story
forwards nor the forty-stanza ballad aft, which the old steersman
was moaning on, careless of listeners, to keep himself awake at
the helm.&nbsp; Forty stanzas or so we did count from curiosity;
the first line of each of which ended infallibly with</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Says the
commodo&mdash;ore;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and the third with</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&lsquo;Says the female
smuggler;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and then gave up in despair; and watched in a dreamy, tired,
half-sad mood, the everlasting sparkle of the water as our bows
threw it gently off in sheets of flame and &lsquo;tender curving
lines of creamy&rsquo; fire, that ran along the glassy surface,
and seemed to awaken the sea for yards round into glittering
life, as countless diamonds, and emeralds, and topazes, leaped
and ran and dived round us, while we slipped slowly by; and then
a speck of light would show far off in the blank darkness, and
another, and another, and slide slowly up to us&mdash;shoals of
medus&aelig;, every one of them a heaving globe of flame; and
some unseen guillemot would give a startled squeak, or a
shearwater close above our heads suddenly stopped the yarn, and
raised a titter among the men, by his ridiculously articulate,
and not over-complimentary, cry; and then a fox&rsquo;s bark from
the cliffs came wild and shrill, although so faint and distant;
or the lazy gaff gave a sad uneasy creak; and then a soft warm
air, laden with heather honey, and fragrant odours of sedge, and
birch, and oak, came sighing from the land; while all around us
was the dense blank of the night, except where now and then some
lonely gleam through the southern clouds showed the cliff-tops on
our right.&mdash;It was all most unearthly, dreamlike, a strange
phantasmagoria, like some scene from &lsquo;The Ancient
Mariner&rsquo;&mdash;all the world shut out, silent, invisible,
and we floating along there alone, like a fairy ship creeping
through Chaos and the unknown Limbo.&nbsp; Was it an evil thought
that rose within me as I said to Claude&mdash;&lsquo;Is not this
too like life?&nbsp; Our only light the sparkles that rise up
round us at every step, and die behind us; and all around, and
all before, the great black unfathomable eternities?&nbsp; A few
souls brought together as it were by chance, for a short
friendship and mutual dependence in this little ship of earth, so
soon to land her passengers and break up the company for
ever?&rsquo;</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>&lsquo;There is a devil&rsquo;s meaning to everything in
nature, and a God&rsquo;s meaning, too.&nbsp; Your friends, the
zoologists, have surely taught you better than that.&nbsp; As I
read Nature&rsquo;s parable to-night, I find nothing in it but
hope.&nbsp; What if there be darkness, the sun will rise
to-morrow.&nbsp; What if there seem a chaos: the great organic
world is still living, and growing, and feeding, unseen by us,
all the black night through; and every phosphoric atom there
below is a sign that even in the darkest night there is still the
power of light, ready to flash out, wherever and however it is
stirred.&nbsp; Does the age seem to you dark?&nbsp; Do you, too,
feel as I do at times, the awful sadness of that
text,&mdash;&ldquo;The time shall come when ye shall desire to
see one of the days of the Lord, and shall not see
it&rdquo;?&nbsp; Then remember that</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The night is never so long<br />
But at last it ringeth for matin song.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even as it is around us here, so it is in the world of
men.&nbsp; The night is peopled not merely with phantoms and
wizards, superstitions and spirits of evil, but under its shadow
all sciences, methods, social energies, are taking rest, and
growing, and feeding, unknown to themselves, that they may awake
into a new life, and intermarry, and beget children nobler than
themselves, when &ldquo;the day-spring from on high comes
down.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even now, see! the dawn is gilding the highest
souls, as it is those Exmoor peaks afar; and we are in the night
only because we crawl below.&nbsp; What if we be unconscious of
all the living energies which are fermenting round us now?&nbsp;
Have you not shown me in this last week every moorland pool,
every drop of the summer sea, alive with beautiful organizations,
multiplying as fast as the thoughts of man?&nbsp; Is not every
leaf breathing still, every sap vein drinking still, though we
may not see them?&nbsp; &ldquo;Even so is the kingdom of God;
like seed sown in the ground; and men rise, and lie down and
sleep; and it groweth up they know not how.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
<p>We both fell into a reverie.&nbsp; The story and the ballad
were finished, and not a sound broke the silence except the
screaming of the sea-fowl, which led my thoughts wandering back
to nights long past, when we dragged the seine up to our chins in
water through the short midsummer night, and scrambled and rolled
over on the beach in boyish glee, after the skate and mullet,
with those now gone; and as I thought and thought, old voices
seemed to call me, old faces looked at me, of playmates, and
those nearer than playmates, now sleeping in the deep deep sea,
amid far coral islands; and old figures seemed to glide out of
the mysterious dark along the still sea floor, as if the ocean
were indeed giving up her dead.&nbsp; I shook myself, turned
away, and tried to persuade myself that I was dreaming.&nbsp;
Perhaps I had been doing so.&nbsp; At least, I remember very
little more, till I was roused by the rattling of the chain-cable
through the hawse-hole, opposite the pier-head.</p>
<p>And now, gentle readers, farewell; and farewell, Clovelly, and
all the loving hearts it holds; and farewell, too, the soft still
summer weather.&nbsp; Claude and I are taking our last walk
together along the deer-park cliffs.&nbsp; Lundy is shrouded in
the great grey fan of dappled haze which streams up from the
westward, dimming the sickly sun.&nbsp; &lsquo;There is not a
breath the blue wave to curl.&rsquo;&nbsp; Yet lo! round
Chapman&rsquo;s Head creeps a huge bank of polished swell, and
bursts in thunder on the cliffs.&mdash;Another follows, and
another.&mdash;The Atlantic gales are sending in their
avant-courriers of ground-swell: six hours more, and the storm
which has been sweeping over &lsquo;the still-vexed
Bermo&ouml;thes,&rsquo; and bending the tall palms on West Indian
isles, will be roaring through the oak woods of Devon.&nbsp; The
old black buck is calling his does with ominous croakings, and
leading the way slowly into the deepest coverts of the
glens.&nbsp; The stormy petrels, driven in from the Atlantic, are
skimming like black swallows over the bay beneath us.&nbsp; Long
strings of sea-fowl are flagging on steadily at railroad pace,
towards the sands and salt-marshes of Braunton.&nbsp; The
herring-boats are hastily hauling their nets&mdash;you may see
the fish sparkling like flakes of silver as they come up over the
gunwale; all craft, large and small, are making for the shelter
of the pier.&nbsp; Claude starts this afternoon to sit for six
months in Babylonic smoke, working up his sketches into certain
unspeakable pictures, with which the world will be astonished, or
otherwise, at the next Royal Academy Exhibition; while I, for
whom another fortnight of pure western air remains, am off to
well-known streams, to be in time for the autumn floods, and the
shoals of fresh-run salmon trout.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the

works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not

copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
